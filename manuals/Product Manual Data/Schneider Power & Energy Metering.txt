Schneider Electric Power Meters are high quality proven and tested instruments that offer simple to advanced power and energy monitoring. They can function
independently or be integrated into a Schneider Power Monitoring Expert (PME) software platform to enable extended data recording, advanced visualization,
analytics, power quality assessment, and compliance reporting.
The meters are designed to cater for a wide range of applications including buildings, industries, datacenters and healthcare. They are well suited for power quality
monitoring, energy conservation tracking, cost management, and cost allocation. They accurately measure key parameters like voltage, current, frequency, power
factor, all aspects of power and energy (active, apparent, reactive), harmonic distortion, and individual harmonics. They are supplied loose for panel-mounting or
optionally on request complete with wall-mount enclosure and accessories.
PM2220: A power meter for general energy usage analysis, bill verification and sub billing. It features a monochrome LCD display with essential energy and power
quality measurements up to 15th harmonic and Modbus RTU communication port.
PM5320: A multi-tariff power meter for energy monitoring and cost management applications in industrial and commercial facilities. It features a monochrome
graphical LCD display with configurable passwords, power and energy measurements with revenue grade accuracy, fundamental power quality measurements up
to 31st harmonic, compliance to international metering standards and BACnet/Modbus TCP/IP communication port. Onboard memory supports logging of 2
parameters for 60 days with 15minutes interval (active & reactive energy) and 40 records of user-defined alarms.
Pm8240: A multi-function power meter with advanced power quality analysis up to 63rd harmonic and energy measurement for reliability and efficiency of powercritical facilities. It reveals complex power quality conditions enabling action to be taken to mitigate any issue. It features patented Disturbance Direction Detection,
sags and swells detection, revenue grade accuracy, multiple communication ports, onboard power quality analysis, web interface and a colour graphical LCD
display with configurable passwords. The meter complies with the most stringent international metering standards with an optional MID variant available on order.
Cybersecurity features include secure protocols (HTTPS, SFTP) and security event logging. Its integral 512 MB of memory supports 50 data logs, 50+ user-defined
alarms with email notifications, high resolution waveform captures, ½ cycle RMS logging, custom web pages, min/max logs, energy trends and Time-of-Use
metering with network synchronization.

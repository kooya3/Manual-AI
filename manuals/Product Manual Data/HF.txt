PUMP
The PEDROLLO HF series are non self-priming closed impeller pumps with close coupled motors for high flow applications. They
are specifically designed for heavy duty industrial and agricultural use and feature adequate passageways in the volute and
impeller to allow pumping of water with a light silt load. The pumps are of back pullout design allowing dismantling without
disconnection of the pump casing from the pipework. The pump body is constructed from cast iron and the impeller from brass
alloy.
MOTOR
Pumps are close coupled to Pedrollo brushless TEFC induction motors designed for continuous operation. Single phase motors are
provided with a thermal cutout in the windings to protect against electric and mechanical overload and can be connected directly
to the mains power supply through a 10Amp fuse or MCB. Three phase motors require remote DOL starter protection according to
local regulations.

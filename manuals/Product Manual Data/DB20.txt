PUMP
The DAYLIFF DB range of horizontal multistage centrifugal pumps are commercial quality products designed for continuous duty in
various water transfer applications. The pump has small physical dimensions, axial suction port and radial discharge port and is
base plate mounted. Pump construction is AISI304 for the suction chamber, pump head, the impeller and impeller housing. Both
pump and continuously rated motor unit are of monoblock design, and particular attention has been paid to quietness and smooth
operation.
MOTOR
The pump is coupled to a totally enclosed, fan cooled squirrel-cage motor. Single phase motors include a built in thermal overload
protection and should be connected to mains power through a 10A fuse or MCB. Three phase motors should be installed with a
remote starter.

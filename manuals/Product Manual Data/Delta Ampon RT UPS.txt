Amplon RT
UPS

Delta Amplon RT series are high performance Uninterruptible Power Supplies (UPS) that provide consistent sine-wave power to critical
equipment even when mains power fails. The UPS offers best in class efficiency and reliability, and is ideal for Industrial, Medical, Servers,
Data center and Telecommunications applications. Salient features include:
• True online double-conversion topology and zero transfer time to battery ensure high reliability.
• Wide input range allows the UPS to operate in harsh electrical environments and extends battery life.
• Hot swappable batteries ensure continuous operation even when batteries are being replaced.
• Optional VRLA and Li-ion (RT 5-20kVA only) external battery cabinet (EBC) for easy scaling of longer backup time.
• Up to four units' parallel capacity for RT 5-10kVA allows redundancy and load expansion
• Power Distribution Box and Maintenance Bypass Breaker are a default on RT 5-10kVA standard runtime models.
• Convertible rack and tower configuration in 2U size cabinet.
• Remote emergency power off (REPO) port to shut down UPS completely or switch off inverter only (Remote turn on/off - ROO
function).
• Smart/Mini slots for fitting optional Modbus and SNMP communication cards for integration to external monitoring and control
systems.

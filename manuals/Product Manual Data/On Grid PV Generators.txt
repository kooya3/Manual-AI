With the economic costs of PV modules and advanced inverter technology, PV power generation in on-grid installations for domestic
and commercial applications is a practical and cost effective proposition. The key is efficient system controllers and by using the latest
technology inverters Dayliff offers unbeatable systems, the PV power output being synchronised with the mains grid power supply to
provide an efficient hybrid system that directly utilises all the PV power being generated with the balance of the network requirement
being provided from the grid. Capacity is determined by the output of the solar array and by the specification of the inverter, systems up
to 100kW being available. Basic systems provide no battery back-up and are dependent upon mains supply availability, though backup batteries and a separate control inverter can also be specified that will provide power in all conditions. System components
include:• A PV module array mounted on a roof or at ground level depending on space availability. The individual module size is
specified according to customer preference and system size.
• A Huawei inverter/controller that inverts and synchronises the DC PV output into the local power network. All Huawei inverters
use state-of-the-art intelligent technology and can also be used to control hybrid systems incorporating battery back-up and
generators. A range of Huawei accessories are also available to tailor systems to individual customer requirements.
PV Power Generation is becoming increasingly popular due to its efficiency, the cost savings available and its eco-friendliness and
investment cost is now very competitive. This combined with the reliability and advanced technology of Huawei controllers make PV
power generation a most practical solution to supplement power in all on-grid power networks.
Systems are individually specified according to site conditions, size and installation requirements. Packages suitable for home or small
commercial sites have been specified in the table below though larger systems can be designed on request.

PUMP
DAYLIFF SUNFLO-X Range of pumps are high specification solar powered centrifugal and helical rotor DC pumps specifically designed for wells/borehole
applications and feature a remote surface mounted controller. Pumps are constructed principally from AISI 304 stainless steel and are engineered to the highest
standards to give serviceability, excellent efficiency, high reliability and long life.
MOTOR
Pumps are fitted with Permanent Magnet brushless high efficiency, maintenance free DC motors without integrated electronics specifically designed for maximum
efficiency. They should be powered by solar arrays configured to provide the input voltage required and sized at approximately 130% of the rated motor power.
Insulation Class: F

Enclosure Class: IP68

Speed: 4000rpm

CONTROLLER
Pumps are provided with matched controllers for monitoring, protecting and controlling pump operations with the following features:• Protection against reverse polarity, overload and over temperature.
• Integrated MPPT (Maximum Power Point Tracking) with 99% energy conversion efficiency to maximize module power output.
• Fully automatic operation and complete protection including low level control, dry running and over/under voltage.
• Enhanced pump start on low sun intensity.
• Easy trouble shooting, where fault code is displayed on LCD screen for fast identification and problem solving.
• Enclosure Class: IP52
PUMP OUTPUTS
Performance curves are given at standard test conditions of 1000W/m2 solar irradiance and 250C. Output will vary throughout the year depending upon prevailing
irradiation levels. For estimated daily outputs at continuous pumping multiply the indicated output at the duty point by the daily irradiation given in Graph 1. For
indicative purposes factors of 1.1 can be applied for hot arid areas and 0.9 for temperate high altitude areas in the Tropics. Output will vary throughout the day as a
proportion of the estimated hourly irradiation as shown in Graph 2.
OPERATING CONDITIONS
Pumped Liquid: Thin, clean, chemically non-aggressive liquids with a sand content of less than 0.1%.
Maximum Liquid Temperature: 0-350C
Controller Ambient Temperature: -200C to +600C
Max Immersion Depth: 70m
Minimum Borehole Diameter: 125mm

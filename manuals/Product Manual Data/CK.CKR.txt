PUMP
The PEDROLLO CK/CKR range are self-priming peripheral type liquid ring pumps designed for handling difficult liquids and
pumping conditions. They are especially suited for irregular flow rates, aerated and foamy liquids and viscous liquids like oils and
low volatility fuels and the self priming design makes them suitable for difficult suction conditions.
Pump construction is cast iron body, aluminium motor bracket with cover with brass front anti-locking shim function.and brass
impeller for CK, Bronze for CKR.
MOTOR
Pumps are close coupled to a TEFC brushless induction motor designed for continuous operation. A thermal relay is provided in the
windings to protect against electrical and mechanical overload and the pump can be connected directly to the mains power supply
through a 10amp fuse or MCB.

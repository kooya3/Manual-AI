PUMP
DAYLIFF SUNFLO-A pumps are specifically designed for PV solar powered water supply from wells and boreholes. They are of
rotary screw design and material of construction for the rotary screw is stainless steel with a rubber stator. Pumps are of simple
structure and feature an inbuilt controller.
MOTOR
Permanent magnet, oil filled, brushless, DC motor specifically designed for maximum efficiency from solar module power source. It
should be powered by solar array configured to provide the input voltage and sized at approximately 130% of the rated motor
power.
PUMP OUTPUTS
Performance curves are given at standard test conditions of 1000W/m2 solar irradiance and 250C. Output will vary throughout the
year depending upon prevailing irradiation levels. For estimated daily outputs at continuous pumping, multiply the indicated
output at the duty point by the daily irradiation given in Graph 1. For indicative purposes, factors of 1.1 can be applied for hot arid
areas and 0.9 for temperature high altitude areas in the Tropics. Output will vary throughout the day as a proportion of the
estimated hourly irradiation as shown in Graph 2.

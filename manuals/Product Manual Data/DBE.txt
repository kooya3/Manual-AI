PUMP
The Dayliff DBE Booster is a compact water boosting unit for water supply in domestic and commercial applications for single and two booster
pump systems. The pump is fitted with an integral variable speed controller that maintains pump output at constant pressure (adjustable up to
5bar) with varying demand. The pump is compact for simple installation, quiet with low operating noise level and of robust design for long life.
The speed controller maintains pump performance at maximum efficiency thereby minimizing operating costs.
Particular features include:
• Booster output is adapted to demand by changing speed and number of pumps in operation.
• Automatic pump alternation in multi-pump setup to ensure uniform operating periods.
All hydraulic parts are made from AISI304 stainless steel, and the pump unit is supplied with a 5-way connector, non-return valve, integrated
pressure sensor and appropriately sized pressure tanks, 3L being the minimum recommended size.
MOTOR
The pump is fitted with high efficiency IE4 Permanent Magnet variable speed motor that incorporates thermal protection against motor overload
and dry run protection with auto-restart. The motor can be directly connected to the mains power supply through appropriately sized FUSE or
MCB.

PUMP
The Pedrollo BC range of centrifugal submersible drainage pumps are specifically designed to operate in waste water containing
relatively large amounts of impurities. They are fitted with a double channel impeller for pumping of liquids containing suspended
solids and short fibres.
Construction is epoxy electrocoated cast iron pump body, stainless steel motor housing with cast iron impellers. 5m of Neoprene
cable is supplied for single phase model and 10m cable for three phase models. Single phase models are provided with an external
float switch to automatically control pump start and stop.
MOTOR
Pumps are provided with built-in liquid cooled non-overloading induction motors designed for continuous operation. A thermal
cut-out is provided in the motor windings to protect against pump overload and the pump can be connected directly to the mains
power supply through a 10amp fuse or MCB. Three phase models require a remote DOL starter.

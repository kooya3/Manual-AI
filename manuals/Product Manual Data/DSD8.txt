PUMP
DAYLIFF DSD range of submersible multistage centrifugal pumps are specially designed for water supply from wells and boreholes.
Material of construction include polycarbonate impellers and diffusers, AISI 201 stainless steel delivery and suction chambers and
AISI 304 stainless steel pump housing, shaft and shaft coupling. These corrosion resistant materials together with the advanced
hydraulic design provide the pumps with excellent sand handling capabilities for a longer life and operational efficiency. DSD8/12
is supplied complete with 30m cable and a control box.
MOTOR
The pump is coupled to a sealed liquid cooled 2-pole asynchronous squirrel-cage motor constructed of stainless steel. Single
phase motors should be supplied with purpose designed Dayliff SCM control boxes for operation and protection against overload,
dry running and over/under voltage. Three phase motors require a remote DOL starter; A DAYLIFF SCT electronic Pump Controller
is recommended for comprehensive pump control including low level, motor overload and irregular power supply protection.

time.
• Powder coated sound and weather proof canopies with residential silencer for extremely low noise operation.
• Integral DSE digital control module that provides selectable readout of electrical voltage, phase current, output frequency
and battery voltage and engine speed, hours run, oil pressure and coolant temperature.
• Automatic shut down protection in the event of low engine oil pressure, high engine temperature and over and under speed
with warning indicators provided for each condition.
• Digital automatic mains failure provision for starting the generator. An additional automatic transfer switch is also required for

DERATING: Given outputs are sea level ratings. Sets should be derated at 1% for every 100m higher than 100m above sea level, and 2% for every
50C temperature above 200C for naturally aspirated engines.

MP Rotator

PRO-Spray

PS-Ultra

Hunter's range of spray bodies also known as pop-ups, mist heads or sprinklers are high specification nozzles suited for residential
and commercial irrigation. MP Rotators are best suited in landscape irrigation where low precipitation are demanded to prevent
erosion. PS Ultra are suitable for residential application while PRO spray is designed for both pressure regulated and non pressure
regulated demand in residential and commercial application. Available with either factory or user installed check valves, drain
valves, flushing systems and flow guard mechanisms, systems can be customised to the irrigation requirement. Features include:
• Heavy duty construction to withstand harsh environmental conditions.
• Innovative seal design that reduces flow-by and operates at low pressure to prevent debris from entering the seal.
• Heavy duty springs for positive retraction.
• Pressure regulated up to 2.8bar.
• Flowguard technology that reduces flow in the event of a missing nozzle thereby preventing wastage.
For enhanced performance, sprays may be fitted with spray nozzles to ensure accurate, even delivery of water in the pattern
demanded. These feature crisp, well defined edges and easy grip top for simple adjustment for large water droplets for wind
conditions. Engineered to emit larger than average water droplets, these nozzles are reliable, accurate, and fully adjustable to any
angle from 0° to 360° and radius of 1.2 to 5.2m. They are also colour coded for easy field identification.

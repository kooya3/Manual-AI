The PEDROLLO PK range of peripheral impeller booster pumps are robust, reliable and economical and used principally for water
boosting in domestic and small scale water transfer applications where there is insufficient mains pressure available. The pump
body is made from cast iron with a brass insert set into the front housing for improved starting performance and protection from
jamming.
MOTOR
Pumps are close coupled to a TEFC brushless induction motor designed for continuous operation. A thermal relay is provided in the
windings to protect against electrical and mechanical overload and the pump can be connected directly to the mains power supply
through a 10amp fuse or MCB.

PUMP
The DAYLIFF DIN pump range are of non self priming vertical multistage in-line centrifugal design suitable for a wide range of
water supply, irrigation, liquid transfer and boosting applications. The pumps are of heavy duty construction and designed for
continuous duty in commercial and industrial installations. All DIN pumps feature AISI 316 stainless steel vital components in
contact with water including the impellers, intermediate chambers, shaft and top and bottom housings and are suitable for
pumping highly mineralised corrosive water. All pumps are water lubricated and are provided with a standard cartridge type
mechanical seal. They are supplied complete with BSP internally threaded counter flanges.

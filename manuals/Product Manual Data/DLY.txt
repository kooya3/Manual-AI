DLY
Diesel Engines

Dayliff DLY prime mover diesel engines are of 4-stroke, direct injection, water cooled design suitable for a wide range of stationary
industrial and agricultural applications including water pumps, firesets and generators. All models are naturally aspirated cooled
by forced water circulation and settable for fixed speeds between 1500 to 3000rpm.
Engines feature cast iron crankcases for durability with a mechanical governor and are supplied complete with integral radiator,
cartridge type air, oil and fuel cleaner elements, exhaust silencer, frame mounted fuel tank and electric start with a 12V electric
system. All engines are supplied with an SAE specification housing and drilled flywheel for power take off. Extension shafts are
available to order.
Dayliff engines are powerful, efficient and robust assuring a long life and ease of maintenance. They are the ideal solution for all
stationary diesel power requirements.

Derating: Given outputs are sea level ratings. Sets should be derated at 1% for every 100m higher than 100m above sea level and 2% for every
50C temperature above 200C for naturally aspirated engines.

PUMP
DAVEY PM centrifugal impeller type pool pumps are specially designed for heavy duty applications, particularly institutional and
commercial swimming pools. Features include built-in check valve, quick connect couplings for simple installation, extra large line
strainer with see through lid and computer designed impeller and diffuser for high efficiency, excellent priming performance and
quiet operation.
All pump components are made from glass filled plastics. This pump is compatible with marine conditions, as such it may be used in
fish farming applications.
MOTOR
The pump is fitted with an integral DAVEY ‘large frame’ TEFC heavy duty motor designed to match the pump output. Features
include front mounted fan for improved cooling and motor protection in the event of seal leakage, heavy duty bearings and a
corrosion protected aluminium casing. The motor is provided with an in-built automatic re-start thermal relay for protection against
electrical and mechanical overload and can be connected directly to a power supply through a 13amp fuse or MCB.

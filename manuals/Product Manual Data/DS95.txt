PUMP
DAYLIFF DS submersible pumps are designed specifically for borehole supply applications. They are of multistage centrifugal
impeller design and all parts are made from premium AISI304 stainless steel with water lubricated rubber bearings. A submersible
motor is fitted beneath the pump and suction is effected through a strainer between the pump and motor.
MOTOR
The pump is coupled to a sealed liquid cooled 2-pole asynchronous squirrel cage motor constructed from stainless steel. The
motor requires a remote starter and if unstable supply voltage is likely, an additional quick tripping control relay is recommended.
Note that due to low starting torques of submersible motors, it is recommended that DOL starters are used. A DAYLIFF SCT
electronic pump controller is recommended for comprehensive pump control including low level motor overload and irregular
power supply protection.

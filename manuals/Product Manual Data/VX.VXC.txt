PUMP
The Pedrollo VX/VXC range of submersible drainage pumps are designed to handle industrial waste water and sewage. The open
type impellers make the pumps especially suitable for pumping water containing a high proportion of solid particles including
threads and fibres.
Material of construction is heavy duty cast iron for motor housing and pump body except VX 40/50 whose motor housing is made
from AISI 304 stainless steel. All pumps are supplied with 10m neoprene cable and the VXCm15/45 also includes an integral float
switch for low level control.
Two configurations are available. VX/VXC for either portable or fixed sump applications and VXC-F for sewage installations with
discharge connection and guide bars provided.
MOTOR
Hermetically sealed induction motor designed for continuous duty provided the pump remains partially submerged (min 350mm). A
control box is recommended for the single phase models which should be connected to a fused supply. Three phase models requires
a remote DOL starter.

PUMP
DAYLIFF D3SP pumps are compact 3” diameter submersible multistage centrifugal pumps specifically designed for small scale
water supplies from boreholes and wells. Material of construction is polycarbonate impellers and diffusers, brass inlet and outlet
chambers and stainless steel pump sleeve. All pumps are provided with 20m cable and a control unit.
MOTOR
The pump is coupled to a two pole sealed motor with copper windings and constructed principally from stainless steel. A separate
control unit is included which incorporates an isolator, run indicator light, thermal overload protection and start capacitor which
can be connected directly to mains power. Additional protection by a Dayliff AVS or similar power protection controller is
recommended.

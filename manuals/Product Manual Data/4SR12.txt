PUMP
Pedrollo 4SR12 submersible pumps are specifically designed for water supply from boreholes, though can also be used in other
submersible applications in either vertical or horizontal configuration. They feature a hydraulic design that incorporates floating
impellers which together with especially resistant component materials provide high resistance to sand content in the pumped
water.
The pump impellers and diffusers are made from technopolymer while the stage casings, top housing, suction connector, pump
sleeve and shaft are made of AISI 304 stainless steel.
MOTOR
Pumps are coupled to a Pedrollo two pole sealed motor constructed principally from AISI 316 stainless steel. Drytek control box is
available for both single phase and three phase pump control which incorporates incoming mains isolator, digital display of motor
operating status and protection against over and under voltage, motor overload and phase sequence loss. The controller can be
connected directly to the mains power supply.

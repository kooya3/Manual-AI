PUMP
The DHFS300 is a solar powered booster pump suitable for general water transfer and irrigation applications where grid power is
unavailable. The pump is of centrifugal design with material of construction being cast iron with brass impellers.
MOTOR
The pump is coupled to high efficiency cast iron motor rated for continuous application.
Enclosure Class: IP54

Insulation: F

Speed: 3000rpm

CONTROLLER
The pump is supplied with a separate self-contained multifunction MPPT controller that tracks the solar modules maximum power
output voltage which varies with module temperature and irradiation levels. This ensures maximum current output, typically +25%
higher than conventional module controllers and similar increase in daily water output. The controller also protects from over and
under voltage, over current and short circuit protection, over-temperature protection and features various indicator lights that give
the pumps operating status.
POWER OUTPUTS
Pump output curve is given at standard test conditions of 1000W/m2 solar irradiance and 250C. Output will vary- throughout the
year depending upon prevailing irradiation levels. For estimated daily outputs at continuous pumping, multiply the indicated output
at the duty point by the daily radiation given in Graph 1. For indicative purposes, factors of 1.1 can be applied for hot arid areas
and 0.9 for temperate high-altitude areas in the Tropics. Output will vary throughout the day as a proportion of the estimated hourly
irradiation as shown in Graph 2.
OPERATING CONDITIONS
Pumped Liquid: Thin, clean chemically non-aggressive liquid without solids or fibres.
Max. Ambient Temperature: +350C
Max. Liquid Temperature: +400C

parks and school compounds where night time illumination is required for vision or security. The reliable LED lamps are highly efficient using about 5% of the power
of traditional incandescent alternatives as well as offering greatly extended life due to the much reduced operating temperatures. Recognising these benefits Dayliff
Solar street lights are available in Modular and All-in-One configurations and are specially engineered to provide a reliable, effective and long life lighting
solutions.

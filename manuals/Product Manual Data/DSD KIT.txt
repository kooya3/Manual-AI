Solar pumping is now firmly established as an ideal solution for many water supply applications, AC motor pumps being widely
used together with DC/AC inverters enabling hybrid PV solar/AC mains supply operation. The Dayliff DSD range of borehole
pumps are established and reliable units and when combined with high specification Dayliff Sunverter controllers are efficient and
cost effective applications of this technology. These are now offered as complete kits for simplified installation comprising matched
fully compatible components and all necessary accessories as follows:• A selection of Dayliff DSD borehole pumps specified for the required duty fitted with polycarbonate impellers and diffusers, a
stainless steel pump housing and sealed liquid cooled asynchronous motors.
• The appropriate specification and number of Dayliff Grade 1 PV solar modules with connectors for simplified installation.
• Control unit including a Dayliff Sunverter SVB2 controller and a PV disconnect switch installed in a weatherproof plastic
enclosure. Sunverter SVB2 controllers enable AC/DC operation using either PV DC solar modules or mains grid or generator
AC power and provide full motor protection, soft start and MPPT capability for maximum solar insolation efficiency.
• Accessories including 30m drop cable where applicable, 10m PV module connection cable, HDPE pipe fittings and
galvanised steel wellhead with accessories. Module supports and piping are not included and are supplied extra according
to installation requirements.
Full details of pump performance and specification is given in the Dayliff Product Manual and Dayliff SolarCalc App and should be
referred to when selecting equipment.

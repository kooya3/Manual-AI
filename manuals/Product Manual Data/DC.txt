PUMP
The Dayliff DC range of self priming engine pumps are of fully portable design suitable for irrigation, dewatering and general pumping
duties. All models feature open impellers suitable for pumping lightly silted water and a sturdy carrying and protection frame. Also included
are quick couple hose connectors and suction strainers. Maximum suction is 8m at sea level, though this will be reduced at altitudes.
Pump body and impellers are manufactured from high grade cast aluminium.
Hybrid LPG powered models are available that can also be petrol powered. LPG fueling is from a domestic gas tank with a standard
regulator that is fed into the pump carburetor. LPG benefits include savings of up to 50% on fuel costs and reduced harmful emissions.
ENGINE
Proprietary air cooled, 4-stroke OHV single cylinder with transistorised ignition and oil alert.
Note: Performance curves for all engines relate to the engine governor set at maximum speed of 3600rpm to achieve maximum rated
power output. To prolong engine life pumps should only be run under maximum power conditions for short periods and for extended duty
the throttle setting should be reduced to approximately three-quarters power. Pump performance will then be reduced accordingly.

PUMPVERTER
Pump Controller

DAYLIFF Pumpverter drives are high specification VSD's suitable for use in residential and industrial applications. They are compact and versatile
and can be installed in either motor or wall mounted configuration. The inverter varies pump motor speed with demand thus regulating pump
output to a preset outlet pressure. Particular features include:
• Maintains constant system pressure when water demand changes by use of pressure transducers
• Can work simultaneously with other units and control up to 6 pumps in cascade sequence.
• Sleep mode when there is no water consumption for increased energy savings
• Provides complete pump protection against pump overload, low voltage, high voltage, phase failure, electronics overheating and dry
running (when using float switch).
• Pumpverter 2 allows inclusion of small pilot pump in cascade operation and has special duty-standby operation mode for 2 pump
systems.
• Pumpverter 2 additionally features multiple Control modes including Constant Pressure, Constant Differential Pressure, Constant
Temperature and Constant Temperature Difference
Pumpverter range of inverters are proven and dependable designs using the latest technology to give exceptional levels of performance, economy
and reliability.

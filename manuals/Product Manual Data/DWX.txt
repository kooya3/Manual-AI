PUMP
The DAYLIFF DWX range of waste water pumps are high specification products for use in various drainage applications. Versions
are available with open (DWXD) and vortex (DWXV) impellers. The DWXD model features a jacketed motor casing with top mounted
outlet suitable for lightly silted water and can operate partially submerged. The DWXV model features a side outlet and is suitable for
heavily polluted waters. Material of construction for both models is AISI 304 stainless steel construction throughout. Other features
include single mechanical seals, a low level switch and 10m of power cable for all but DWXV07A which is supplied with 5m cable.
MOTOR
Pumps are provided with dry type two pole motors designed for continuous duty. They are fitted with integral thermal protectors and

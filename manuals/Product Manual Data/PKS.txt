PUMP
The PEDROLLO PKS range of self priming peripheral impeller booster pumps are robust, economical pumps principally used for
domestic supply applications where there is insufficient mains water pressure available. They are fitted with an internal check valve
on the suction inlet to assist with priming and are particularly suited for pumping from in-ground tank installations, especially when
fitted with a 'Presscontrol' automatic control unit.
The pump body is made from cast iron with a brass inset for improved starting performance. The impellers are made from brass.
MOTOR
Pumps are close coupled to a TEFC brushless induction motor designed for continuous operation. A thermal relay is provided in
the windings to protect against electrical and mechanical overload and the pump can be connected directly to the mains power
supply through a 10amp fuse or MCB.

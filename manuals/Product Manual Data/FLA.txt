DAYLIFF FLA packaged Fire Sets are specially designed to provide automatic supply to multiple hose reel or sprinkler outlets for firefighting
installations. Pump sets combine parallel duty diesel and electric powered supply pumps to ensure serviceability in all conditions as well as a
jockey pump to maintain system pressure. Particular features include:• Individual electric motor and diesel engine powered pump sets providing standby supply in the event of electrical power failure
• Separate automatic jockey pump to maintain system pressure and regulate main pump operation
• Bellows type pressure switch controlled operation providing progressive jockey pump, electric pump and diesel pump starting at
reducing cut-in pressures
• Low maintenance diaphragm type pressure vessel to regulate the jockey pump cycling.
• Integral control panel providing automatic parallel operation of the supply pumps and incorporating electrical protection panels and a
DC battery charging system
• Compact frame mounted design incorporating necessary valves and piping for simple site installation
Systems are designed to give rated output of either about 5bar or 10bar and six standard sizes are available 10,20,40,60,100 and
120m³/hr with the two pump sets operating in parallel, 50% standby output being provided in the event of electrical failure.
Fire sets EN 12845 specification certified as compliant by KEBS are also available. Performance and design is similar though some
components are to high level specification as stipulated in the standard.
Dayliff FLA Fire Sets combine quality components for optimal operational efficiency with Dayliff’s unmatched pumping expertise and
competitive pricing to provide effective, reliable and easy to install firefighting solutions.
SPECIFICATIONS
Supply Pumps: Dayliff DE end suction bareshaft pumps featuring gland packing seal, heavy duty cast iron construction, bronze impellers
and diffusers. Pump models are selected to meet the design pressure and flow rates. Detail performance curves are available on request.
Diesel Engine: Dayliff DLA air cooled or Dayliff DLY water cooled with automatic electric start. Alternative engines are available on
request.
Electric Motor: TEFC squirrel cage 2-pole 2900 rpm electric motors suitably rated for the pump load.
Jockey Pump: Option of DB4-60 horizontal multistage pump or Dayliff DIN3-19 vertical multistage centrifugal pump fitted with electric
motor. The pump is set to maintain system pressure at 10bar thus avoids cycling of the service pumps due to minor system leakages.
Pressure Vessel: GWS pressure vessel featuring polyproplene liner with special diaphragm and air valve design that eliminates leaks and
the need for maintenance.
Piping: Suitably sized piping and fittings are provided for direct suction and delivery line connections including necessary isolating gate
valves, non-return valves on the system outlet. The limit of piping is shown in the schematic drawing.
Control Panel: Electric pump control panel with star-delta starter, Jockey pump control panel with DOL starter and engine pump control
panel with DC power circuit for engine and DC battery charging system. The control panels are integrally mounted as standard though can
be supplied loose for remote installation if required.

PUMP
The DAYLIFF DSP range of submersible multistage centrifugal pumps are specially designed for borehole supply applications.
Material of construction include Noryl impellers, glass filled polycarbonate diffusers, stainless steel inlet and outlet chambers,
stage casings, shaft and pump housing. These quality materials together with the floating type impeller design provide the pumps
with efficient performance ,excellent sand handling capabilities and long life.
MOTOR
The pump is coupled to a two pole sealed motor constructed principally from stainless steel. Single phase motors are supplied with
a separate control unit that incorporates an isolator, run indicator light, thermal overload protection and starting capacitor which
can be connected directly to the mains power. The box is also provided with auxiliary terminals for control probes, pressure switch or
float switch. Three phase motors require a remote DOL starter; DAYLIFF SCM/SCT electronic pump controllers are recommended
for comprehensive pump control including wireless low level protection, motor overload and voltage fluctuation.

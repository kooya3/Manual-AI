PUMP
The GRUNDFOS SQ range of compact submersible borehole pumps are suitable for both continuous and intermittent operation in
a wide variety of applications. These include domestic water supply, water transfer and irrigation duties from both boreholes and
tanks and due to excellent starting characteristics, they are particularly suited to pressure control operation. The pumps offer a
number of unique features provided by the built-in GRUNDFOS electronic motor controller including:•
•
•
•
•
•

Run dry protection - no electrodes required
Soft start design avoiding high electrical loads and water hammer - also ideal for generator operation
Over and under voltage protection - ideal for unstable power conditions
Overload and high temperature protection
Excellent wear characteristics - can handle slightly silted waters
3” diameter to fit narrow boreholes.

Hydraulic components are made from polyamide plastic and the special design floating impellers each have a tungsten carbide/ceramic bearing.The pump sleeve, shaft and other principal components are made from stainless steel.
MOTOR
The unique integrated GRUNDFOS MS3 high efficiency permanent magnet motor is controlled by a built in frequency converter
which increases the standard mains frequency enabling the pump to run at high speed. All control functions are built into the
frequency converter and no additional motor protection is required other than a 13amps fuse or MCB.

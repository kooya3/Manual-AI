The KOHLER range of naturally aspirated air and water cooled diesel engines are proven and dependable designs suitable for a
wide range of prime mover applications including pumps, generators, maize mills, concrete mixers, dumpers etc.
The KOHLER range specification include a cast iron crankcase for durability, individual cylinder direct injection combustion system
for easy starting and low fuel consumption, centrifugal governor and mechanical fuel lift pump. They are supplied with 12V electric
start, electro stop, muffler and panel board with warning indicators for high temperature and low oil pressure. Two models are
available as follows:KD
KD range features two cylinder air cooled variable speed engines with settable speed between 2000 to 3000rpm. The engines are in
ECE R 24 emission compliant stage and are supplied complete with engine mounted fuel tank, PTO drive shaft, oil bath air filter and
are fitted with recoil rope for emergency start.
KDI

DERATING: Given outputs are sea level ratings. Sets should be derated at 1% for every 100m higher than 100m above sea level, and 2% for every
50C temperature above 200C for naturally aspirated engines.

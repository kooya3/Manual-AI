PUMP
Pedrollo Tritus Grinder pumps are of exceptionally robust, heavy duty specification specially designed for shredding solids and
fibres found in wastewater and sewage allowing them to pass through small diameter pipes without blockage in domestic,
agricultural, industrial and building site applications. The pump is provided with a superior and effective grinder made of
hardened, highly resistant AISI 440F stainless steel and the pump body is made from heavy duty cast iron protected with an epoxy
electrocoating (TGIm motor casing made of AISI 304 stainless steel). Other features include an open technopolymer impeller for
0.75kW to 1.1kW and AISI 304 stainless steel for the 1.5kW to 3kW pumps, double mechanical seals, a low level float switch with a
patented fitting system (single phase pumps)and 10m cable.
MOTOR
The pump is fitted with an integral TEFC motor and powered with a hermetically sealed induction motor with thermal overload
protector incorporated into the winding. Single phase pump are supplied complete with an external floatswitch and control box
with a manual reset motor protection with a starting and operating condenser while three phase pumps require a remote DOL

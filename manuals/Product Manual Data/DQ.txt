PUMP
DAYLIFF DQ circulator pumps are designed for hot water circulation in heating, hot water, cooling and air conditioning applications in open or
closed systems. They can also be used for pressure boosting in domestic dwellings and for circulation in solar hot water systems. Specifications are
offered as follows;
DQ15F - A single speed pump that includes a built-in flow switch which activates pump operations whenever there is supply demand. This is
particularly applicable to domestic shower pressure boosting.
DQ 25/32 - Pumps are provided with 3 speed settings for selection of the ideal flow to meet system requirements. No automatic switching is
provided.
Pump construction is cast iron pump housing, glass fibre reinforced polypropylene impeller, stainless steel rotor and ceramic bearing support. All
pumps are supplied complete with female threaded BSP union connections.
MOTOR
The integral 2-pole asynchronous squirrel-cage motor is designed to operate at three speeds (except DQ15F). All motors include an inbuilt
capacitor and overload protection and can be connected directly to mains supply through a 5A fuse or MCB.

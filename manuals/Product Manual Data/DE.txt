PUMP
The Dayliff DE range of end suction centrifugal pumps are rugged heavy-duty pumps designed for various water supply, irrigation
and fire fighting duties in agricultural, commercial and industrial applications. The pumps feature gland packing seal for simple and
economic maintenance, back pullout design enabling removal of the rotating element without disturbing the pipework connections
and heavy duty bearings.
A wide range is available and pumps can be modified for specific duties by adjustment of the impeller diameter which must be done
with reference to the particular pump curve. Motors should be selected according to the pump speed and impeller diameter and
mounted together with the pumps on a base frame with coupling. The pumps are also suitable for belt drive by either electric motor or
a diesel engine. Pump construction is heavy duty cast iron casing with stainless steel shaft and bronze impeller.
Temp Range: -100C to +1050C

Max Operating Pressure: 16Bar

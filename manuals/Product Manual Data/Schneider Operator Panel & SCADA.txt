Pumping

HARMONY HMI
Harmony ST6 HMI (Human Machine Interface) is a high-resolution touch screen advanced operator interface for controlling automation systems in various
industry operations including Pumping, HVAC (heating, ventilation and air conditioning), Food & Beverage and Packaging. It is particularly suited for
operation at pump stations with multiple pumps and motors. The HMI features improved user experience through an intuitive design powered by modern
visualization software Ecostruxure Operator Terminal Expert. It is offered as a standard in 12” or 15” display size, and assembled in an enclosure complete
with accessories which may include PLCs (programmable logic controllers) depending on the use case. The HMI is compatible with multiple PLC models
enabling direct integrations with existing control systems. Salient features include:
• User access management and operation logs ensuring security and traceability.
• Data logging and trend graphs
• Alarm summary with alarm message, type, data and time it was reported or restored.
• Web Viewer function allowing remote monitoring and control from PC/Tablet/Phone
• Aluminium front panel with status LED for signaling operating status
• Communication via Ethernet with Enterprise systems (SCADA, MES and ERP) using OPC-UA protocol.

EMSE SCADA FOR PUMPING
Ecostruxure Machine SCADA Expert (EMSE) is a modern and scalable Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system designed for efficient pump
station control and monitoring. The SCADA is deployed on PC Workstations/Servers and accessible from Thin Client stations within the Local Area Network
(LAN). Optionally, remote access via the internet can be set up using Virtual Private Network (VPN).
EMSE enables centralized control and real-time monitoring of multiple pump stations. Instantaneous data acquisition from instrumentation allows tracking
and reporting on various water parameters including volumes pumped, flow rates, pressure, levels and quality. Integral alarm management ensures prioritized
alarm notifications on dashboards and e-mail. Other salient features include:
• Intuitive user interface with customizable dashboards and graphical displays.
• Data Management with secure data logging, storage, and report generation.
• Support of backup or secondary data server for redundancy - used when primary data server is unavailable.
• Multiple security options for thin client access including IP whitelisting, disabling commands and SSL encryption.
• Integration of SQL databases and native drivers for communication with PLCs and enterprise systems (MES, ERP).
• Native OPC interface including OPC UA and OPC DA for data exchange with third party systems.
EMSE is supplied with a perpetual runtime license specified to a maximum tag count (1.5K, 4K, 32K & 64K) complete with one thin client access license.
Additional think client access licenses (HMIEMSETCA) can be purchased to allow access of the SCADA from other computers within the facility intranet and
also enable SCADA display on multiple screens in control rooms.

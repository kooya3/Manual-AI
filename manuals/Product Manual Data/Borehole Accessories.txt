PVC BOREHOLE PIPES

Dayliff PVC Borehole pipes are available in 3m lengths in standard,
heavy and super heavy duty specification for different pressure ratings
in sizes from 1¼” and 3” and all installations include steel pump and
well head connectors. For extra deep installations a piping/connector
bracing kit is available for additional security. They offer very
considerable advantages over traditional steel pipe alternatives and
are the ideal solution for all borehole pump installations.

** Super Heavy Duty Pipes

PVC Sheath (Blue)

Dayliff submersible cables are specially selected for motor power
supply in all borehole pumping applications. They are of 4-core type
and available in sizes from 1.5 to 25mm, all using plain annealed
flexible copper strands as the conductor. All cables are designed for
heavy duty use with excellent resistance to oils, chemicals and solvents
and are suitable for temperatures up to 400C. Two types are available,
round blue rubber sheathed to HO7RN-F specifications with
conductor sheath coloured brown, blue for the blue PVC sheathed flat
cable.

Cable should be sized to limit voltage drop from power source to motor to a maximum of 5%. See table on page 421 for ratings.

Dayliff Well heads are complete units to terminate the top of a
borehole. They comprise a strong steel borehole cover plate with
dipper access, drop cable/surface cable junction box and pump outlet.
They are available as standard in sizes from 1¼” to 4”for both 6”and
8”boreholes, though other specifications are available on special
order. They are supplied complete with adapter set and adapter box as
loose components.

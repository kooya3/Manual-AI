The Dayliff SF range of water softeners are ion exchange type softeners for the removal of hardness in water. The units have been carefully designed to
provide the highest levels of performance for all types of domestic, industrial and institutional applications.
Particular features include:
•
•
•
•
•

An extended model range with capacities from 1 to 20m3/hr with higher capacities being available using paired units.
Technology leading Dayliff electronic control valves providing fully automatic process control and volumetric regeneration.
High performance resin with enhanced 75gms CaCO3/litre exchange capacity and increased life.
Generously sized brine tanks with all the necessary fittings for reliable regeneration.
An option of a Low Pressure vessel rated at a maximum of 3 bar using tried and tested Dayliff CXD non-corroding GRP vessels or High
Pressure Dayliff PXD (designated H-version) vessels rated at a maximum of 10 bar using high specification Dayliff Structural pressure tanks.

Dayliff SF softeners provide a most effective, reliable and economic solution for all boiler feed and other general softening requirements. The
combination of quality components, integrated design and assured Dayliff quality ensures efficient and dependable softeners that can be relied upon
to give many years of trouble free operation
SOFTENER SIZING
Softeners are rated by their exchange capacity, which is the quantity of Calcium that is removable between regenerations and is determined by the
resin performance and specified in gms CaCO3. Equipment sizing is then computed on the basis of the raw water hardness and the required brine
regeneration period, 24hrs generally being the minimum. An example for sizing an SF600 unit is as follows:Exchange Capacity: If resin capacity is 75gms CaCO3/litre and resin volume 350litres, =75x350 = 26,250gms CaCO3
Softening Capacity: Assume water hardness = 300ppm CaCO3 = 26,250/300 = 87.5m3
Flow Rate: Assuming a 20hr operating period/day required flow rate = 87.5/20 = 4.4m3/hr, therefore SF 600 is suitable
Note that softening performance is reduced by increased TDS levels and it is necessary to compute compensated hardness when TDS levels are
greater than 400ppm as follows:Compensated Hardness (ppm CaCO3) = Measured Hardness (ppmCaCO3) x 9,000
9,000 - TDS level(ppm)

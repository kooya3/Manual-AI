PUMP
The DAYLIFF DCI pump is of non-self priming closed impeller centrifugal type designed for continuous duty in high flow
dewatering, irrigation, water transfer and emergency water supply applications. It is diesel engine powered and material of pump
construction is cast iron throughout. Pumps are supplied with quick couple suction and inlet connections, a strainer and a sturdy
carrying and protection frame is also provided.
ENGINE
Reliable and economical DAYLIFF air cooled 4-stroke OHV single cylinder, direct injection diesel engine with recoil start and low oil
alert.
Note that performance curves for all engines relate to the engine governor set at maximum speed to achieve maximum rated power
output. To prolong engine life pumps should only be run under maximum power conditions for short periods and for extended duty
the throttle setting should be reduced to approximately three-quarters power. Pump performance will then be reduced accordingly.

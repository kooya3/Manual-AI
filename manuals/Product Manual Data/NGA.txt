PUMP
The PEDROLLO NGA pump is a non self priming centrifugal open impeller pump with close coupled motor. It is designed for
pumping water and chemically non-agressive liquids containing impurities and suspended solids and is suited for a wide range of
industrial, irrigation and transfer duties. The pump is of back pullout design allowing dismantling without disconnection of the
pump casing from the pipework.
Pump body is constructed from cast iron and the impeller from AISI316 stainless steel.
MOTOR
Pumps are close coupled to TEFC brushless induction motor designed for continuous operation. A thermal relay is provided in the
windings to protect against electrical and mechanical overload and the pump can be connected directly to the mains power supply
through a 10amp fuse or MCB.

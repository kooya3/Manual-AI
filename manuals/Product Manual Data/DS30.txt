PUMP
DAYLIFF DS submersible pumps are designed specifically for borehole supply applications. They are of multistage centrifugal impeller design and
all parts are made from premium AISI304 stainless steel with water lubricated rubber bearings. A submersible motor is fitted beneath the pump
and suction is effected through a strainer between the pump and motor.

MOTOR
The pump is coupled to a sealed liquid cooled 2-pole asynchronous squirrel cage motor constructed from stainless steel. The motor
requires a remote starter and if unstable supply voltage is likely, an additional quick tripping control relay is recommended. Note that due
to low starting torques of submersible motors, it is recommended that DOL starters are used. A DAYLIFF SCT electronic pump controller is
recommended for comprehensive pump control including low level motor overload and irregular power supply protection.

1 Standard filter specification. Greater pressure capacities are available if required.
2. Maximum capacity is rated at 40m/hr, standard capacity at 20m/hr and minimum
capacity at10m/hr filtration velocities. Equipment flow rates should be set on the
basis of medium specification and raw water quality. Advice should be taken from the
equipment supplier.
3. Operating weight includes media and water.

The DAYLIFF 'FC' range of pressure sand filters are proven and reliable designs for general water treatment and swimming pool
applications. They are available in standard capacities up to 170m3/hr, though greater capacities can be provided by the
installation of a number of filters in parallel. Features include:• A selection of eight standard models available in different diameters, the smaller diameters being supplied in standard and
deep bed configurations.
• Mild steel plate construction with domed ends for enhanced pressure capacity with optional heavier gauge steel plate being
offered for high-pressure applications. Stainless steel is also available for specialised food grade installations.
• Suitable for various medias including silica sand for sediment removal activated carbon for taste, odour and chlorine
removal, activated carbon for fluoride removal and anion resin for softening.
• 400mm diameter bolted access cover for easy media charging and removal. Deep bed filters also feature a low-level side
cover to facilitate media removal and general internal maintenance.
• Standard internal bitumised coating for corrosion protection and long life. A GRP lining is optional for aggressive liquids.
• High efficiency internal distribution and collection manifolds to ensure even filtration throughout the filter area and effective
backwash flows.
• The option of 'Novasfer' ball type manifold mounted valves or 'Midas' single lever multi-port (up to 2'') control valve
arrangements.
Multiple connection installation options are available including series connection for increased filtration performance and parallel
connection for high flow rates.
For the successful application of pressure filters it is important to match media and flow rate to the quality of the incoming water.
Technical advice is available on correct specifications for individual applications.
The DAYLIFF range of pressure filters are established products which have been progressively upgraded over many years of
production. They are robust, reliable and effective and offer the ideal solution for a wide range of water treatment requirements.

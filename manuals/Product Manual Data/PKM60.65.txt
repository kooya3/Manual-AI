PUMPS
The Pedrollo PKm is a robust, reliable and economical pump used principally for water transfer in domestic and small scale water
transfer applications. The pump body is made from cast iron with a brass insert set into the front housing for improved starting
performance and protection from jamming. The impeller is made from brass.
The pumps have been remodelled and re-engineered offering the following benefits;
• Quiet operation due to the anti vibration system between shaft and impeller
• More compact
• More efficient motor with low energy consumption and lower operating temperature
• Special paint which gives improved resistance against environmental corrosion
• Extended life
Pumps can be installed for manual or automatic control using either the recommended ‘Pedrollo Easysmall’ controller or a pressure
tank and switch. Also available is the integral ‘Hydrofresh’ version (PKm60) only which combines a 24L horizontal diaphragm tank,
pressure switch and gauge with pressure settings of 1.4 bar for pump start and 2.8 bar for pump stop.
MOTOR
Pumps are close coupled to a TEFC brushless induction motor designed for continuous operation. Overload protector is provided
in the windings to protect against electrical and mechanical overload and the pump can be connected directly to the mains power
supply through a 10amp fuse or MCB.

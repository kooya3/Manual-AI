PUMP
Dayliff Sunflex is a multistage centrifugal submersible pump designed for water supply from boreholes and wells. A particular feature is hybrid capability with the option of
running the pump on DC solar or AC mains supply or generator power with an external intelligent MPPT controller incorporating a frequency converter automatically
configuring to the connected input power source. Other features include:•
Pump construction is of hard-wearing stainless steel throughout including impellers and stages with water lubricated bearings.
•
External motor controller incorporating MPPT capability for DC power input and Power Factor Correction for AC power input to maximise power input efficiency with
DC power automatically prioritized.
•
Wide voltage range and flexibility for both AC and DC power sources.
•
Built-in dry running protection.
•
Soft start operation to extend motor and pump life.
•
Motor protection including overload/underload and overvoltage/undervoltage sensing.
Dayliff Sunflex is a cost-effective and reliable solution for hybrid water supply where both solar and mains power supplies are available. The pump incorporates a number of
innovative technology features to optimize system efficiency and minimize operating costs and provides unbeatable flexibility for all borehole applications.
MOTOR
The pump is coupled to a canned type water filled brushless permanent magnet variable speed motor that can be powered either by AC or DC power supply. The motor is
provided with an external control module which uses MPPT technology to continuously optimize DC input efficiency and provides protection against over and under voltage
and electrical and mechanical overload.
For optimal performance it is recommended to size the PV solar module array with a nominal output about 30% greater than the specified motor size and ensure that the input
voltage is between the specified limits.
EXTERNAL PUMP CONTROLLER
An external controller is available to enhance pump functionality which primarily provides for power source selection of either DC only, AC only or Auto which prioritizes the use
of DC solar over mains/generator AC power and switches to AC when DC solar power is insufficient or unavailable. It also provides for on/off switching, digital VAC and VDC
values, connection for a high-level control switch with 'Full' indication, 'Low' warning for low borehole water level and system Error warning. Other added Functions and features
of the external controller:
• Protection against low and high voltage, over current , over temperature, high and low water level (15min recovery) and over load
• Displays voltage, current, power, rotation speed, error code, running time
Enclosure Class: IP68

Insulation Class: F

Max DC Input Voltage: 430VDC

Speed Range: 500–4,500rpm

PUMP OUTPUTS
Performance curves are given at standard test conditions of 1000W/m2 solar irradiance and 250C temperature. Output will vary throughout the year depending upon
prevailing irradiation levels. For estimated daily outputs at continuous pumping multiply the indicated output at the duty point by the daily irradiation given in the graph. For
indicative purposes, factors of 1.1 can be applied for hot arid areas and 0.9 for temperate high altitude areas in the tropics.
OPERATING CONDITIONS
Pumped Liquid: Thin, clean, non-aggressive liquids without fibres or particles with a sediment concentration not exceeding 50gms/m3
Max. Liquid Temperature: 400C
Max Immersion Depth: 100m
Installation: Pump should be installed vertically

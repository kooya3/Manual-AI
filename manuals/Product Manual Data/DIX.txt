PUMP
The Dayliff DIX range of pumps are of non self-priming vertical multistage in-line centrifugal design incorporating inverter controllers suitable for a wide
range of water supply, irrigation, liquid transfer and pressure boosting applications. The pumps are of heavy-duty construction designed for continuous duty
in commercial and industrial applications and are quiet in operation. Pumps feature AISI 316 stainless steel for all hydraulic components in contact with
water and are water lubricated with a standard cartridge type mechanical seal. They are supplied complete with BSP internally threaded counter flanges.
Particular features include:• Integrated pressure set variable frequency inverter drive regulated by system demand that minimises energy consumption, reduces mechanical load
and reduces operating cost
• Smart touch screen providing visual presentation of operating data, fault indication and set-up options
• In-built pump protection including high and low voltage, phase failure, overcurrent and motor overload, dry running and low flow cutoff with
operator permission setting.
• Supplied with a pressure sensor to monitor and maintain pump's output at set constant pressure point
• Can be installed individually or with up to 4no pumps connected in parallel for Booster set applications
• Automatic pump alternation in multi-pump booster systems to ensure automatic and uniform master to slave transfer and continuous operation in
the event of pump failure
• Digital connectivity interface for BMS applications (Modbus RS485 communication port)
MOTOR
Pumps are coupled to IE5 permanent magnet variable high-speed motors complying with IEC standards and giving exceptional operating efficiency. The
integral controller provides for soft start eliminating water hammer and other protection features enabling the motor to be directly connected to the mains
power supply through an appropriately sized Fuse or MCB. This gives high levels of motor protection for long life and saves the cost of a supplementary
motor control panel.

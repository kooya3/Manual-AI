KOMPACT
Chemical Dosing Pump

AML

DPT

Dayliff Seko Kompact chemical dosing pumps are high specification products for the accurate dosage of a wide range of chemicals
in general water treatment and industrial process applications. They are of positive displacement diaphragm type with microprocessor based magnetic solenoid motors.
All pumps feature corrosion resistant PVDF-T for the pump heads (with manual priming), PTFE diaphragms, FPM seals and ceramic
ball valve for universal chemical resistance. The pumps are also supplied with complete installation kits including foot valve,
mounting screws, injection valve, 2m PE delivery tube, 4m PVC suction and bleeding tube and a wall mounting bracket.
Two pump models are available:AML (Analogue) - Constant flow rate, manually adjustable using control dial on front panel with two frequency ranges, 0-20%
and 0-100% for max flow rate. Pumps are fitted with an operating status LED that indicates stroke cycles and fault conditions and
level control input for the solution tank.
DPT (Digital) - General specification is as for the AML model with the additional features of selectable manually adjustable
constant flow or proportional flow according to an external analogue or digital signal. Also included is timed dosing with a
programmable timer and a digital display that reads various operating parameters.

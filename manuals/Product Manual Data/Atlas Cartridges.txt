Sediment filtration

The finely pored ceramic material provides ultra
filtration for the removal of particles, microorganisms
and bacteria. The cartridges should periodically be
cleaned by scrapping and pre-filtration is required.

Very fine particle filtration with large filtering surface
providing long service period, high flow and low
pressure drop. Pre-filtration is required.
Removal of chlorine, taste, odour, insecticides,
pesticides and herbicides. The upward flow design
ensures maximum contact time through the bed. Prefiltration is required. The plastic housing is refillable
when the media has expired.

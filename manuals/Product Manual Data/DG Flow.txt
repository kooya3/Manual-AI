DGFLOW STEADYPRESS is an inline water-cooled VSD suitable for light duty residential applications. It uses standard voltage/frequency ratio
control with in-built electronic pressure transducer to maintain constant pressure.
Particular features include:
• Direct mounting on pump or on delivery pipe.
• Keeps system pressure constant when water demand changes.
• Can work simultaneously with other STEADYPRESS units and control up to 3 pumps in cascade sequence.
• Integrated mains filter.
• Switch and external fuse.
• Provides complete pump protection against pump overload, dry running, low voltage, high voltage, electronics overheating, open head
(low outlet pressure) and low water level (when using float switch)
• Enclosure Class: IP65
• Max Flow: 12m3/hr, Max Pressure: 10Bar
DGFIT drives are high specification VSD's suitable for use in residential and industrial applications. They are compact and versatile and can be
installed either on motor or wall mounted configuration. The inverter incorporates a pressure transducer which regulates pump motor speed with
demand thus controlling pump output at a preset pressure.
Particular features include:
• Air cooled
• Keeps system pressure constant when water demand changes
• Can work simultaneously with other DGFIT units and control up to 3 pumps in cascade sequence.
• Provides complete pump protection against pump overload, dry running, low voltage, high voltage, electronics overheating, open head
(low outlet pressure) and low water level (when using float switch).
• Enclosure Class: IP54

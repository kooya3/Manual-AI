Dayliff Power Backup Systems are specifically designed for small domestic and commercial applications to provide standby power in the
event of mains power supply failure. They can be used as an alternative to a generator and have many advantages including:• Instantaneous and automatic changeover when the mains power fails which is especially beneficial when used with electronic
equipment such as computers and TV's.
• Totally silent and non polluting operation which particularly suits enclosed space applications.
• Very low running costs - just the power to charge a battery.
During normal power conditions the inverter maintains the batteries at full charge while during a power failure the DC battery energy is
seamlessly converted to AC power and fed to the supply circuits. Systems include two principal components, a reliable and efficient
Dayliff Ultraverter/Optiverter, a DC/AC power inverter with built in battery charger and a battery bank.
Ultravertres and Optiverters are Transformerless inverters with precision Pure Sinewave output and full function LCD status displays
monitoring various operating parameters. Sizes are available from 1,000W to 8,000W output.
The endurance of a power backup system is determined by battery capacity, Dayliff systems being offered with a selection of capacities
depending upon backup time required. Batteries supplied are with options of Valve Regulated Lead Acid (VRLA) or Lithium Ion
Phosphate (LiFePO4) and the inverters provide automatic regulation to prevent over-charge and over-discharge. Systems are also
provided complete with connecting cabling between the inverter and battery pack and expert selection advice is available to assist with
sizing and installation.
The components of all Dayliff Backup Systems are carefully matched in terms of quality and performance and they provide a reliable,
effective and economic solution to all small scale mains standby power requirements.
INSTALLATION
Dayliff Power Backup Systems should be installed between the main electricity meter and the distribution board as indicted in the wiring
diagram. It is important to separate the installed loads so the back up system is not connected to high consumption appliances like
cookers, water heaters, washing machines, pumps etc. This may require some re-wiring of the distribution board and it is recommended
that a qualified electrician is consulted.
Note that the indicated backup times are approximate and based upon the loads indicated. They are entirely dependant upon the loads
applied and will vary accordingly.

PUMP
The Grundfos UPA mini circulator pumps are designed for pressure boosting of domestic potable and hot water supplies with
particular applications for showers, taps and water feeds to appliances. Pumps incorporate a flow switch for automatic on demand
operation. They are for use in open systems and the option of manual or auto operation can be selected.
Pump construction is stainless steel encapsulated rotor, rotor can and bearing plate, polycarbonate impeller and cast iron pump
housing. Pumps are supplied with a female threaded BSP union connection set.
MOTOR
UPA 15-90 & 120: Pumps are fitted with an integral 2-pole asychronous squirrel-cage motor, that includes a built-in thermal
switch which monitors winding temperature and cuts off the power supply in the event of overload. No remote overload protection is
required, though the pump must be connected to a suitably rated MCB or fuse.
UPA 15-160: Pumps are fitted with a synchronous 4-pole electronically commutated motor with permanent magnet rotor that is
energy efficienct with proven quality. Pumps must be connected to a suitably rated MCB or fuse

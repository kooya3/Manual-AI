PUMP
SolarPlex is a high specification, high pressure solar powered DC booster pump principally designed for general water supply
applications. It is of 5 stage centrifugal design with hydraulic end and impellers being constructed from AISI 304 stainless steel and is
engineered to the highest standards to give serviceability, excellent efficiency, reliability and durability.
MOTOR
The pump is fitted with an air cooled continuously rated high efficiency maintenance-free permanent magnet brushless DC (BLDC) motor
with high quality bearings and in-built temperature sensor specifically designed for maximum efficiency and durability. It should be
powered by a solar array configured to provide the input voltage required and sized at approximately 130% of the rated motor power.
Insulation Class:F

Enclosure Class:IP56

Speed:4000rpm

CONTROLLER
The pump-features an integral controller with simple direct PV connection for monitoring, control and protection with the following
features:
• Automatic protection from overload, overtemperature, reverse polarity & locked rotor
• Fully automatic operation and complete protection including dry running and over/under voltage protection as well as tank full
control
• Integrated MPPT (Maximum Power Point Tracking) with 99% energy conversion efficiency to maximize module power output, about
+25% higher than conventional module controllers resulting in a similar increase in daily water output
• Enhanced pump start on low sun intensity for more water output
• Easy trouble shooting, with easy to read LED display for faults and problem solving
PUMP OUTPUTS
The performance curve is given at standard test conditions of 1000W/m2 solar irradiance and 250C. Output will vary throughout the year
depending upon prevailing irradiation levels. For estimated daily outputs at continuous pumping multiply the indicated output at the duty
point by the daily irradiation given in Graph 1. For indicative purposes factors of 1.1 can be applied for hot arid areas and 0.9 for
temperate high-altitude areas in the Tropics. Output will vary throughout the day as a proportion of the estimated hourly irradiation as
shown in Graph 2.
OPERATING CONDITIONS
Pumped Liquid: Thin, clean, chemically non-aggressive liquids without solids or fibres
Maximum Liquid Temperature: +500C
Maximum Ambient Temperature: +500C

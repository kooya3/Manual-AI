Mixtron proportional chemical feeders are an effective solution for accurate in-line injection of a wide range of chemicals for
various water treatment, agricultural and industrial applications. Installed directly on the raw water supply line, a hydraulic motor
pump uses the water flow as its energy source. This pump in turn activates the dosing piston. Particular benefits are:• Fully automatic operation with dosage directly proportional to flow.
• Simple to install and no external power source required.
• Highly accurate and consistent dosage with adjustable concentrate ratios between 0.2 to 10%.
• Accommodates large dosage ranges and operating pressures.
Mixtron is principally used for water treatment applications particularly chlorination. Installation is simple and can be in line taking
the full water flow or on a bypass for larger flow rates. Specialized application products are available on request.
Built principally from high quality engineering plastics and incorporating simple mechanical components, Mixtron feeders are
designed for long-term reliability and durability, and are on excellent solution whenever consistent and accurate chemical dosage is
an essential requirement for any production or environmental process.
OPERATING CONDITIONS
Feed Water: Thin, clean non aggressive liquids without fibres or particles pre-filtered to atleast 300 micron (50mesh). Pretreatment is required for feed water with higher levels of suspended solids.
Chemical Concentrate: Thin, clean chemicals including most acids, alkalis and polymers for standard units. Special models are
available for aggressive and viscous chemicals and can be specified on request.
Operating Water Temp: Min 50C – Max 400C
Average Dosage Accuracy: +/-5%
Repeatability: +/-3% (API standard)
Suction Performance: Self-priming, max4m
Viscosity: PV kit required above 200 cSt at 200C and max with PV kit 400 cSt

PUMP
DAYLIFF DQA is a revolutionary variable speed controlled circulator pump designed for hot water circulation in heating, cooling
and solar applications. The pump is provided with a number of unique features:
• Variable Speed inverter technology that enables the pump to selectively operate on a constant curve, proportional
pressure where pressure is adjusted according to system demand and constant pressure where pressure remains
constant irrespective of system demand.
• Three selectable speeds so the pump performance can be matched to system requirements.
• Fully automatic function which continuously adjusts pump output to system demand and thus optimises energy
consumption.
• Display indicating power consumption and as well as alarm and warning conditions.
Pump construction is cast iron for the pump housing, stainless steel for the rotor can and composite plastic for the impeller. Pumps
are supplied complete with BSP union connections.
MOTOR
The pump is fitted with an integral synchronous permanent-magnet high efficiency inverter controlled motor. The pump should be
connected to a suitably rated MCB or fuse.

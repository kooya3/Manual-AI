VDB

Variable Speed control is a widely used technology for pump control and works by varying the pump speed to provide system water output at a
constant pressure. This provides the following benefits:
• Constant pressure providing consistent, even supply to the consumer.
• Large energy cost savings as systems are always operating at peak efficiency for the demand conditions.
• Extended pump life due to reduced electrical and mechanical operating loads.
• Silent operation with no pressure shocks.
• Simplified installation due to compact dimensions and integral pump control - no separate panel is required.
Principle system components include the controller, which is mounted on the pump motor or
on the pump skid, a quality Dayliff pump, a pressure sensor and a small surge tank to smooth
the operating cycle. Controllers offer the following features:• Varies pump speed to maintain pre-set system pressure.
• Over voltage, under voltage, single phasing and electrical overload protection.
• Dry run protection with auto restart.
• Integral soft start/soft stop function which extends pump life, reduces system pressure
loads and reduces mains power loadings on start up.
• One controller can control additional pumps and multiple controller systems can be
synchronised for sequenced pump operation.
• Balanced pump operation ensuring equalised operating periods for each system pump.

All Dayliff booster sets use the latest technology controllers coupled to quality Dayliff pumps
and are supplied complete frame mounted with inlet and outlet manifolds and valves for
simple installation. Nominal system sizes are 2.5, 4 and 6 Bar, though pressures can be set to
suit site conditions and the option of two and three pump configurations are available.
Three pump systems can be specified with three controllers or two controllers/1 DOL start unit. In all systems pump operation is sequenced with
the number of pumps operating increasing with system demand.
Variable speed drive is now accepted as the most efficient way to provide on-demand water supply in all sorts of industrial commercial and
domestic applications. Dayliff booster sets are the ideal solution in the application of this efficient technology.

SPECIFICATIONS

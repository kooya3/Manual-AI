PUMP
CR Series pumps are of non self priming multistage centrifugal impeller design suitable for light, higher pressure water transfer
applications. They are also particularly quiet in operation and suitable for automatic pressure supply installations using either a
surge tank or Pedrollo ‘Easy small’ controller.
Pump construction is 'Noryl' technoplastic impeller and stages with a stainless steel pump body except 5CRm100 which is made of
stainless steel impellers and pump body and diffuser in Norly
MOTOR
Pumps are close coupled to a TEFC brushless induction motor designed for continuous operation. A thermal relay is provided in the
windings to protect against electrical and mechanical overload and the pump can be connected directly to the mains power supply
through a 10amp fuse or MCB.

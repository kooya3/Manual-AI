PUMP
The Pedrollo 4BLOCK is an innovative adaptation of the conventional 4SR borehole submersible pump design incorporating an
integral pump/motor unit in one compact unit. Hydraulic and motor components are the same, though they are encased in a onepiece housing thus providing a more economic alternative to the traditional borehole pump. Particular features include:• High resistance independently floating delrin impellers providing the pump with a light silt passing capability.
• Integrated design incorporating a built-in capacitor so no separate control unit is required.
• 20m drop cable supplied as standard
The 4BLOCK range is particularly suitable to all small-scale domestic installations particularly for boreholes, though they can also
be used in wells in either vertical or horizontal configuration. All pump components other than engineering delrin impellers and
noryl diffusers are manufactured from AISI304 grade stainless steel.
MOTOR
Pumps are fitted with integral two-pole Pedrollo motors constructed principally from stainless steel. A built-in thermal overload for
motor protection is provided so the pump can be connected directly to the mains power supply through a 10A fuse or MCB.

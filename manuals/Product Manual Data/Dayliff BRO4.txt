DAYLIFF BRO4 Reverse Osmosis water treatment plants are simplified specification versions of the well-established Dayliff DRO
range specifically designed for removal of lighter concentrations of dissolved salts at lower cost. The heart of the system remains
efficient low energy Dayliff membranes though control and component specifications are adapted for less arduous operating
conditions with the plants being thoroughly engineered to provide reliability with the highest treated water standards. They offer the
following features:• High efficiency low energy brackish water membranes housed in strong corrosion resistant FRP pressure vessels
• Pre filtration through 5mic sediment filter
• High efficiency Dayliff Feed /Cleaning pump
• Pump controller providing automatic and dry running protection
• Corrosion proof U-PVC high pressure piping
• System monitoring instruments including flow meter and pressure gauges
• Semi-automated plant operation including RO feed water flushing cycle and CIP facility
• Compact skid mounted design for simple installation and transportation
All DAYLIFF RO plants are highly efficient, easy to operate and simple to maintain and offer the ideal solution for small and medium
scale reverse osmosis requirements.
Solar power option is available on request.
OPERATING PARAMETERS
Raw Water Quality: TDS level of up to 500ppm, Chloride level <50ppm, Turbidity <1NTU, Iron <0.1ppm, No free chlorine
Normal Rejection: 95%-98%
Water Temperature: 5-350C, Design Temperature 250C
Operating Pressure: 3- 6bar
Recovery Range: 30-60% depending on raw water quality. System recovery is entirely dependent on water quality; higher TDS or
silt content will reduce the maximum possible recovery and flow rates
Treated Water Quality: TDS level of below 100ppm

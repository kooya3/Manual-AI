PUMPVERTER 2
Pump Controller

DAYLIFF Pumpverter 2 drives are high specification VSD's suitable for use in residential and industrial applications. They are compact and
versatile and can be installed in either motor or wall mounted configuration. The inverter varies pump motor speed with demand thus regulating
pump output to a preset outlet pressure or temperature.
Particular features include:
• Suitable for constant pressure, constant differential pressure, constant temperature, and constant differential temperature water supply
applications.
• Maintains constant system pressure when water demand changes by use of pressure transducers.
• Can work simultaneously with other units and control up to 6 pumps in cascade sequence.
• Special two pump system modes for duty-standby operation or inclusion of small pilot pump in cascade operation.
• Sleep mode when there is no water consumption for increased energy savings
• Provides complete pump protection against pump overload, low voltage, high voltage, phase failure, electronics overheating and dry
running(using sensor or sensor less means).
• Interfaces for connection to BMS or SCADA systems for remote monitoring - Modbus RS485 , 2 volt-free contacts, 1 4-20mA analog
output.

ROTODISK AUTOMATIC FILTER

Single head
auto lter

Multi head
auto lter

Rotodisk automatic filters are made from polyamide reinforced with fiberglass and available
for 2” and 3” pipe sizes. A complete unit consists of a single Rotodisc or battery assembly,
backwash valves, manifolds (inlet, outlet and discharge) and a filter automation kit.
Assemblies can be in single units, twin or batteries and are capable of handling high filtration
volumes while maintaining great portability and a small footprint. Flow rates range from
24m³/hr to 640m³/hr. Features include:
• Self-cleaning
• Stainless steel clamp for easy servicing
• Maximum working pressure: 10bar at 200C.
• Filtering element: Disk with deflector
• Filtration surface: 1400cm2 for single head model and 2800cm² for twin model
• Filtration grade: 75, 120 and 155 mesh with 120 recommended for irrigation
applications.
• Minimum backwash pressure: 2.8 bar

LOW PRESSURE VALVES

Low pressure solenoid irrigation valves for automation of low pressure systems especially drip
kits and kitchen gardens. They are of plastic construction and fitted with a 24VAC actuating
solenoid.
Operating Pressure Range: 0.05 bar to 1.0 bar.
Flow Rate: 0.05 to 5m³/hr
Connection: 1” Female thread

NUTRIGATION AND
AUTOMATION EQUIPMENT

Irrigation controllers and nutrigation equipment offering a wide range of options from the
basic analog time and flow based controllers to more complex digital EC and pH monitoring
equipment.
The Commander series of controllers and fertilizer injectors offers precise fertilizer and acid
injection into irrigation systems and are suitable for both large and small scale in either soil or
hydroponic applications. They are adaptable to both cable and radio frequency control
applications. Specifications include;
• Maximum number of irrigation valves: 216
• Maximum outlet port connections on radio: 96
• Maximum digital outputs: 1 water meter, 6 fertilizer meters, 1 differential pressure
gauge, 10 configurable.
• Analogue input options: temperature, solar radiation, EC, pH.
• Pump management: 1 master pump and up to 4 auxiliary pumps.
• Injection channels: up to 6 for both EC and pH.
• Backwash filter management: up to 10 filters.
• Programmer power supply options: 230VAC and 12VDC.
• Output power: 12VAC, 12VDC
• Communication: GPRS, WI-FI, Ethernet with web interface.

P1 16mm DRIPLINE

Light drip line is of lay-flat type that provides excellent performance, reliability and versatility.
The flat dripper design gives low localized head losses resulting in high uniformity of
application along the drip line thus allowing longer lateral lines. Specifications include;
• Available in emitter spacings: 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60cm
• Wall thickness: 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.45, 0.6mm
• Pressure range: 0.9 to 2 bar.
• Can be used for sub-surface irrigation.

PUMPS

fountain and water transfer applications. Two versions are available, the standard S version with open impeller for lightly turbid
water and the vortex V version for water with higher silt loads.

MOTORS
Pumps are provided with integral non-overloading induction motors designed for continuous operation. A thermal cut-out is

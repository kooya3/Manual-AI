Genesys Reverse Osmosis chemicals have been specifically designed to improve the all round performance of Reverse Osmosis Plants enabling
them to operate efficiently even in areas where feed waters are challenging.
General details of the products available are as follows. Detailed specifications and application information being available on request:Description

Chemical

Application

Geneoc PWF
Flocculant
Packaging: 25Kgs

Improved
performance of
RO pre-filtration
equipment

A general purpose flocculant PolyDADMAC for use in surface, well and process waters with medium to
high SDI values. Genefloc PWF should be dosed continuously to feed water allowing at least 5 minutes
contact time before filtration. Typical dose rate of Genefloc PWF is 2-5mg/l.

Genesol 20
Packaging 5Kg

Reverse Osmosis
Powder Membrane
Preservative

Genesol 20 is a powdered membrane preservative for MF/UF and NF/RO systems. It enables
membrane storage in-situ – thus avoiding costly shipping, off site preservation & storage – while also
reducing the potential for biological growth in ancillary equipment. Genesol 20 is a safe & effective
solution to ensure for long-term preservation of membrane systems without loss of performance.
Genesol 20 should be used as a 2% solution using permeate only and is to be recirculated for at least
15min before the shutdown. After storage, rinse the membranes for 30 mins with permeate before
resuming operation.

Genesol 37
Packaging: 25Kgs

Reverse Osmosis
Low pH
Membrane
Cleaning

An inorganic strongly acidic cleaner effective for removal of inorganic scale and iron deposits in
Reverse Osmosis and Nano-filtration membrane systems. Genesol 37 is highly effective when used as
a 1-2% solution and alternately soaked and recycled through the membrane system for 1-2hours. At
this concentration, its self-adjusting pH ensures highest solubility of iron deposits, inorganic scales and
proteinous deposits.

Genesol 38
Packaging: 25Kgs

Reverse Osmosis
Low pH
Membrane
Cleaning

An inorganic scale cleaner and iron deposit remover for use in Reverse Osmosis and Nano-filtration
membrane systems. Used at the right concentration, its self-adjusting pH ensures highest solubility of
iron salts is achieved. Genesol 38 is highly effective when used as a 3-4% solution and alternately
soaked and recycled through the membrane system for 4-6hours.

Genesol 80
Packaging: 25Kgs

Reverse Osmosis,
Nano-filtration
and Ultrafiltration
Membrane
Cleaner - Targets
Biofilm

A highly effective biofilm cleaner for Reverse Osmosis, Nano-filtration and Ultrafiltration membrane
systems.. Biofilm predominantly consists of materials secreted by bacteria under stress. Genesol 80
can be used offline as part of the normal membrane CIP procedure at a concentration of 2% v/v. It can
also be applied continuously online with a dose rate of 10-40mg/l depending on the severity of the
biofouling or on intermittent basis every 4-8 hours at 10-80mg/l to inhibit biofilm formation and
maintain a clean membrane surface.

Genesys 703
Packaging: 25Kgs

Reverse Osmosis
High pH
Membrane
Cleaning

A general-purpose cleaner for organic based foulants found in Reverse Osmosis and Nano-filtration
membrane systems with particular application in removal of aluminium silicate. It is highly effective at
a solution of 1-2% at the maximum allowable pH recommended by the membrane manufacturer and
should be alternately soaked and recycled through the membrane system for 4-6 hours. Cleaning
with warm solutions is advised for improved efficiency. After cleaning, the membrane system should
be thoroughly flushed out until the pH values of the feed and discharge are the same.

Genesys 704
Packaging: 25Kgs

Reverse Osmosis
High pH
Membrane
Cleaning
(Microbubble
technology)

A general-purpose cleaner for a wide range of organic based foulants found in Reverse Osmosis and
Nano-filtration membrane systems. Genesol 704 is particularly effective against aluminium silicate,
which can be difficult to remove with conventional cleaners. It is also effective against most microorganisms such as bacteria, fungi and algae. Genesol 704 should be used as a 1-2% solution at the
maximum allowable pH recommended by the membrane manufacturer. It should be alternately
soaked and recycled through the membrane system for 2-4 hours.

Genesys LF
Packaging: 25kg

Reverse Osmosis
Antiscalant
Pre-Treatment

A broad spectrum liquid antiscalant for use in Reverse Osmosis and Nano-filtration systems. It is
effective at preventing inorganic scale, particularly calcium carbonate, iron and silica thus reducing
the frequency of membrane replacement and cleaning. Genensys LF should be dosed continuously to
the feed water upstream of the cartridge filters. Typical dosage rates are 2-5 mg/l.

Genesys SI
Packaging: 25kg

Reverse Osmosis
Antiscalant
Pre-Treatment

An antifoulant for use in Reverse Osmosis and Nano-filtration systems operation on high silica feedwaters. Genesys SeI is also effective against all common scale forming salts such as calcium
carbonate, calcium, barium and strontium sulphate. Genesys SI should be dosed continuously to the
feed water upstream of the cartridge filters. Typical dosage rates are 2-5mg/l.

Reverse Osmosis
Antiscalant
Pre-Treatment

A broad spectrum antiscalant and antifoulant for use in small and recycling Reverse Osmosis and
Nano-filtration systems with less than 100m3/day of feed water flow. Genesys RC is effective at
preventing all inorganic scale formation thus reducing the frequency of membrane cleaning and
replacement. Genesys RC allows systems to be designed and operated at higher recovery rates.
Genesys RC should be dosed continuously to the feed water upstream of the cartridge filter. Typical
dosage rates are 7-15mg/l.

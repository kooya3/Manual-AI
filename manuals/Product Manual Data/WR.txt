PUMP
The PEDROLLO WR series are in-line close-coupled centrifugal pumps with flanged inlet and outlet connections. They are
designed to work with heating, air conditioning, cooling and circulation systems in civil and heavy industrial applications. The
pump body and cover are constructed from cast iron with cataphoresis treatment while the impeller and diffuser is made from AISI
304 stainless steel.
MOTOR
Pumps are close coupled to a TEFC brushless induction motor designed for continuous operation and three phase IE3 version
optimised to work with inverters for efficient and quiet operation. Single phase IE2 motorshave intergrated thermal protection with a
cpacitor and can be connected directly to the mains power supply through a 10Amp fuse or MCB. A remote starter with thermal
oveload should be fitted for three phase versions.

PUMP
The DAYLIFF DDG pump is of single stage centrifugal impeller self priming design suitable for small scale irrigation, water boosting
and water transfer applications. Materials of construction are AISI304 stainless steel for the pump body, shaft and back plate with
the impeller made from polypropylene. The pump is provided with a handle for easy portability, priming screw and a drain plug.
Also available is the ‘AutoPress’ automatic booster system which incorporates a 19L horizontal diaphragm tank, pressure switch
and pressure gauge for automatic pump operation.

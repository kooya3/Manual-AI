PUMP
Pedrollo 4SR2-S submersible pumps are specifically designed for water supply from boreholes, though can also be used in other
applications in either vertical or horizontal configurations. They feature an upgraded specification with a revised floating impeller
hydraulic design and advanced high wear resistance materials for the impellers and diffusers. This provides exceptional sand
handling capability (up to 200g/m3) and improved operating efficiency.
Pump impellers are made from high-strength Delrin technopolymer, diffusers from Noryl and the stage casings, top housing,
suction interconnector, pump sleeve and shaft from AISI304 stainless steel.
MOTOR
Pumps are coupled to Pedrollo 4PD two pole sealed oil filled motor constructed principally from AISI 316 stainless steel. Drytek
control box is available for both single phase and three phase pump control which incorporates incoming mains isolator, digital
display of motor operating status and protection against over and under voltage, motor overload and phase sequence loss. The
controller can be connected directly to the mains power supply.

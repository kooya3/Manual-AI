Dayliff Ultrasun UFS Flat Plate Solar Hot Water Systems are efficient and economical water heaters that provide excellent performance in all
domestic and small scale institutional applications. They are of Thermosyphon design and options of Direct type (models UFS D) with outlet water
being heated directly by circulation through the solar collector or Indirect type (models UFS I) for use with mineralized waters with heat being
transferred to the outlet water storage tank via an external jacket containing thermal fluid that is circulated through the collectors in a closed loop
system. Features include:• Direct System Tanks: Heavy duty stainless steel SUS304 storage cylinder encased in an insulated powder coated UV stabilised galvanised
steel casing fitted with an auxiliary 2.4 kW thermostat controlled electric heater and sacrificial anode for corrosion protection.
• Indirect System Tanks: Enamel lined galvanised steel storage cylinder with sealed peripheral jacket attached encased in an insulated
powder coated UV stabilised galvanised steel casing fitted with an auxiliary thermostat controlled electric heater (1.5 kW 150/200 litres,
3kW 300 litres) and sacrificial anode for corrosion protection.
• Ultra high efficiency solar collectors incorporating capillary copper pipes ultrasonically welded on a black chrome back plate covered by
high transmission glass.
• Insulated copper pipes complete with necessary compression fittings, pressure release valve and a drain cock.
• Galvanised mounting frame.
• Offered with 5-year Guarantee
Dayliff UFS water heaters are available in three sizes and are effective and robust water heaters designed for many years of trouble-free operation.

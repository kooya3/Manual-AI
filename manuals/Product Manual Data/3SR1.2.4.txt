PUMP
Pedrollo 3SR submersible pumps are specifically designed for domestic and small scale water supply from boreholes, though they
can also be used in other submersible applications in either vertical or horizontal configuration. They feature a hydraulicdesign that
incorporates floating impellers which together with resistant component materials provide high resistance to sand content in the
pumped water.
The pump impellers and diffusers are made from Delrin and Noyrl respectively while the stage casings, top housing, suction
connector, pump sleeve and shaft are made of AISI 304 stainless steel. The pump is supplied with a 1.5m tail cable.
MOTOR
Pumps are coupled to Pedrollo two pole sealed oil filled motor constructed principally from AISI 316 stainless steel. A Drytek
Controller is available for single phase pumps which incorporates a fused rotary switch, run indicator light, thermal overload with
manual reset and capacitor which can be connected directly to the mains power supply.

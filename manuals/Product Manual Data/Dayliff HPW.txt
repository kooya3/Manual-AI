Dayliff HPW Heat Pump Hot Water Systems are designed for all domestic water heating applications that utilise the high efficiency
benefits of heat pump technology. The integral systems combine a hot water storage tank with an efficient heat pump that generates
heat from ambient air by utilising the natural heat generating phenomenon of the gas evaporation/condensation cycle. This is
transferred to the stored water by circulation through a coil type heat exchanger in the tank. Tank construction is carbon steel with
internal enamel coating and a magnesium anode is fitted for cathodic protection against corrosion. The tank is lined with high
grade thermal insulation for heat retention. Particular features are:• HPW heat pumps work best under ambient temperature of between -70C to 430C
• High quality integral heat pump fitted on top of the hot water cylinder with quiet GMCC compressor that provides a
Coefficient of Performance (COP) of up to 4.16 (at 200C Ambient temp, 150C Water temp) and settable hot water
temperature of up to 750C. This provides up to 80% power savings compared to conventional element heaters.
• Tube type heat exchanger coiled externally around the water tank for performance and safety with inbuilt sterilising function
• Integral 2kW electric heating element for temperature boosting
• Digital controller for operational and timer settings and fault indication
• Supplied complete with ozone friendly R134A regrigerant gas for optimal efficiency
• 80-liter version suitable for vertical wall-mounted installations
Dayliff HPW systems are high efficiency, high performance water heaters and are the ideal solution for all residential hot water
supply requirements.

PUMP
The DAVEY Dynaflo pump range are heavy duty non self-priming horizontal end suction centrifugal pumps with integral electric
motors. They are particularly suited to water transfer and general boosting applications in horticulture, farming and industrial
situations due to their high grade construction and continuously rated motors.
Pump bodies are constructed from glass filled noryl for the 6210 model and cast iron for the 6220 and 6230 models. Impellers are
non-corrosive glass filled polycarbonate. The 6220 & 6230 models are also available in 316 stainless steel for the transfer of
seawater, they are widely used in marine industry, seaside resorts, RO plants and fish farming applications.
MOTOR
The pump is fitted with an integral DAVEY ‘large frame’ TEFC heavy duty motor specifically designed to match the pump output.
Features include front mounted fan for improved cooling and motor protection in the event of seal leakage, heavy duty bearings
and a corrosion protected aluminium casing. Single phase motors are provided with an in-built automatic re-start thermal overload
for protection against electrical and mechanical overload and can be connected directly to a power supply through a 13 amp fuse
or MCB. Three phase motors require remote DOL starter protection.

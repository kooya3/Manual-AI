DAYLIFF Pressure Booster Sets are the effective way to provide continuous water supply to multiple consumer outlets and offer many
advantages over gravity supply systems including:• Higher line pressures
• Reduced risk of water contamination
• Compact design requires little space
• Elimination of tank structure improves site architecture
• Substantial capital cost savings
Considering these advantages DAYLIFF Booster Sets have been carefully specified for local conditions and are suitable for all applications
from domestic to large institutional size. Particular features are:• Pedrollo and Dayliff pumps provide optimal operating performance.
• Easy maintenance diaphragm type pressure vessels.
• Comprehensive control panels complete with mains isolator, pump overload protection and run indicator lights. Optional extras
include ammeters, hour meters and current control relays.
• Bellows operated pressure switches easily adjustable for cut-in and differential operating pressures.
• Compact frame mounted design incorporating necessary valves and piping for simple site installation.
SYSTEMS OPTIONS
Two basic types of systems offered, either for Single or Parallel pump operation. The parallel pump systems can also be configured to
duty/standby, duty assist configurations or alternatively be fitted with variable frequency drives depending on the use case.
Single pump systems provide for only one 100% duty pump. This arrangement can be provided with either one or two pumps, two pump
systems operating on a duty/standby basis. Pump changeover can be manual or automatically alternating after each duty cycle. Parallel
pump systems provide for sequential pump operation including two 50% duty pumps with the second pump operating only at higher
demand levels. This arrangement has the advantage of reduced energy consumption and reduced capital cost for a given capacity
requirement, though continuity of supply is provided in the event of one pump breakdown. For particular applications special designs
incorporating more than two pumps or pumps of different size available.
Properly engineered booster systems provide very considerable advantages over more traditional gravity systems and they are now widely
accepted as the most efficient and cost effective method of water distribution. By combining the best quality components and many years
experience of system design the DAYLIFF range of booster sets provide performance, reliability and value. With the assured service support
of Davis & Shirtliff there is no better solution to water distribution available.
SPECIFICATIONS
All DAYLIFF Booster sets include the following:
Pumps(s):Pedrollo and Dayliff centrifugal pumps fitted with
motors rated for continuous operation.
Pressure Vessel(s):Vertical fabricated steel pressure vessels with
standard rubber diaphragm.
Piping:Suitably sized piping and fittings are provided for direct
suction and delivery line connections including necessary isolating
gate valves and non- return valves on the system outlet. The limit of
piping is shown in the schematic drawing.
Control Panel: Panel specification is selected according to pump rating and system configuration. Dayliff Smart2 electronic controllers
are specified for two pump sets, settable for both single and parallel operation, which feature automatic pump changeover, level alarm
connections and adjustable motor overload protection. Other panels specifications vary with system model depending upon motor size.
Mounting Frame:All equipment are mounted on Stainless steel or Galvanised frame to simplify site installation.

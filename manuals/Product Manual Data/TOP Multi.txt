mechanical seals with intermediate oil chamber for total motor sealing and simple design for ease of maintenance. Pump
construction is fiberglass reinforced techno plastic body and suction filter with Noryl impellers and diffusers. All pumps are fitted with
a low level control float switch and 10m cable as standard. Models are available as follows:MULTI Standard - For basic drainage and water boosting in submerged in-tank applications

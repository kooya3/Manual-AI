REVERSE OSMOSIS MEMBRANE
Dayliff MRO Reverse Osmosis Membranes are the key components in reverse osmosis
water treatment plants used for removal of dissolved salts in low turbidity waters. They
are of ultra low-pressure design that provides high energy efficiency giving reduced
operating costs together with high salt rejection performance and a high quality
specification for operating durability and long life. Two basic specifications are
available for brackish and high salt level feed waters in both 4” and 8” sizes to
accommodate the majority of RO applications.
MRO Membranes output is split between treated Permeate flow and high TDS Reject
flow. Recovery rates (% Permeate to feed flow) depends on water quality and site
operating conditions though is typically between 50-70% for brackish water and 2050% for Sea Water. Membranes periodically require flushing and anti-scalant dosing.
OPERATING PARAMETERS
Maximum Feed Water SDI: <5
Maximum Feed Water Temperature: 450C
Maximum Membrane Pressure Drop: 1 Bar
Feed Water Free Chlorine: Zero

ULTRAFILTRATION MEMBRANES
Dayliff MUF Ultra Filtration membranes are the filtering medium in ultrafiltration treatment plants for the removal of small size
suspended solids and colloidal pores in raw waters including macromolecular pollutants, bacteria, viruses and
microorganisms. The membranes are designed to be installed in standard pressure vessels that provide ease of operation and
maintenance.
The special membrane design is of hollow fiber type structure that provides enhanced water quality, high backwash flow for
greater flushing of trapped pollutants and tolerance to high levels of chlorine and pH levels. These features provide enhanced
quality water with extended life.
MUF Membranes operate at full input flow output though require periodic backwashing, frequency depending on site
conditions, though every hour is usual.
MUF membranes are designed for installation in standard pressure vessels. IUF membranes are for larger capacities plants
and are provided with integral membrane housing.
OPERATING PARAMETERS
Feed Water Quality: Turbidity <0.2, SDI<3
Operating Pressure: 0.2-2Bar
Operating pH Range: 2-11
Operating Temperature Range: 5-45°C
Backwash Frequency: Every 20-60mins
Maximum Trans Membrane Pressure (TMP): 2Bar

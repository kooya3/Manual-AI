PUMP
The DAVEY XF range of booster pumps are of centrifugal single impeller design with high specification integral electric motors. They
are particularly suited for water transfer in domestic, agricultural and industrial applications due to their high grade construction
and continuously rated motors.
Construction material for the XF171 & XF221 is glass filled noryl for the pump casing and glass filled polycarbonate for the impeller.
XF211SS and XF311SS models use 304 stainless steel for all pump components including the casing and impeller.
MOTOR
The pump includes an integral Davey TEFC permanent split capacitor type motor specified to match the hydraulic load. The motor is
provided with an in-built thermal cutout for overload protection and can be connected directly to the mains power supply through a
10 amp fuse or MCB.

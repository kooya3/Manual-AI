Pressure vessels are important components in automatic booster systems, the vessels cushioning pressure surges as the pump starts
and stops and also provide drainage supply in to the system to reduce pump cycle frequency.
DAYLIFF Global Max pressure tanks are high specification units that are suitable for high pressure applications and include the
following features:
• Super thick steel construction with polyurethane and epoxy painted paint finish for corrosion protection
• Polypropylene liner so tanks can be used for corrosive and hard waters
• Special diaphragm and air valve design that eliminates air leaks and the need for maintenance.
DAYLIFF Global Max pressure tanks are comprehensively tested and quality approved by a number of international standards
organisations and are also FDA food grade approved pressure tanks. They are the ideal solution for all high specification water
booster applications and will provide many years of maintenance free operations.
PRESSURE TANK SIZING GUIDE
Correct tank sizing is important and is determined by the system flow rate and pump start and stop pressure settings. Sizing must be
based upon the system flow at which the maximum cycle frequency occurs. As a rule of thumb this can be taken as average flow
between the cut-in and cut-out flow rates.

Required drain volume is then the maximum cycle frequency flow divided by twice the specified maximum number of
cycles per hour. Generally 60 cycles per hour is considered acceptable. Tank size selected is then that nearest to the
volume required. Some selected examples are as follows;

• Ensure that the difference between start and stop pressure is as high as possible
as the larger the differential the greater the tank drainage capacity.

consumption, reduced cycling, extended pump life due to reduced wear and
reduced noise. As a rule doubling the calculated size will bring substantial benefits.

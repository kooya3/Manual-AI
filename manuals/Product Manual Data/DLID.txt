DLID
Lithium Iron
Phosphate Battery

Dayliff DLID Lithium Iron Phosphate (LiFePO4) batteries with Battery Management System control are high performance products
matched to the Dayliff Ultraverter and Growatt multifunction inverters with principal applications for solar power system storage
and mains power supply backup. They offer considerable benefits including enhanced power output, considerably extended life
and cooler operation in high temperatures and are especially suited to high specification installations. Particular benefits include:• Design life of up to 3000 cycles at 80% DOD, greater than 4 times the life of a comparable Lead Acid type.
• Lighter weight but higher energy density to similar capacity Lead Acid alternatives.
• Constant discharge voltage that enables the battery to deliver nearly full power until it is fully discharged.
• Low self-discharge rate of 3% per month.
• Built in battery charge/discharge protection.
• Excellent resistance to over and under charge with no damaging effects.
• Maintenance free, totally safe and environmentally friendly.
• Batteries can be connected in parallel (up to 8No) to provide higher capacity.
•Also offered with a flexible pay-per-use payment plan suited for productive use of energy (PUE) applications.
In every aspect of performance Lithium Iron Phosphate batteries offer a much superior solution over the Lead Acid alternatives and
though of higher capital cost deliver the more economical long-term outcome due to their greatly increased life, consistent power
output and better charge/discharge performance. For high specification systems where enhanced performance is demanded and
reliability is essential, they are the optimal choice.

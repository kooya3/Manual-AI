Reverse Osmosis is a proven technology to remove dissolved solids in water. At the heart of the system is the membrane, though the
effectiveness of treatment relies on the correct matching of all components to provide an efficient treatment process, DAYLIFF plants
being carefully engineered to provide reliability with the highest treated water quality.
Systems are frame mounted with all components conveniently accessible and are designed to provide low energy consumption and
long life. Standard models are suitable for low (up to 2000ppm) and medium (up to 5000ppm) brackish water applications though
systems for treating higher salinity levels and sea water are available to special order. All offer the following features:• High efficiency 8” RO membranes specified to suit the water quality housed in strong, corrosion proof GRP pressure vessels.
• High treatment performance with up to 98% salts rejection
• High pressure in line multi stage stainless steel feed pump
• System monitoring accessories including inlet and outlet flow meters, pressure gauges and conductivity meter
• Electronic controller for fully automated plant operation including startup, periodic flush cycle and shut down as well as
providing various system alarms
• Sediment removal cartridge pre-filters
• Skid mounted for simple installation
• Corrosion resistant stainless steel high pressure and plastic low pressure pipes and pipe fittings.
All DAYLIFF RO plants are highly efficient, easy to operate and simple to maintain and offer the ideal solution for small and medium
scale Reverse Osmosis requirements.
Solar Power option is available on request.
OPERATING PARAMETERS
Raw Water Quality: TDS level of up to 2,000ppm for the Low Brackish Water and up to 5,000ppm for the Medium Brackish
Water Plant, Chloride level should be less than 350ppm, no chlorine, total hardness <200ppm and no suspended solids. A raw
water analysis should be provided to establish the extent of pre-treatment necessary.
Normal Rejection: 95%-98%
Water Temperature: 5-350C, Design Temperature 250C
Minimum Inlet Pressure: 3bar
Operating Pressure: Ranges between 4 bar and 20 bar depending on raw water quality
Recovery Range: 35% - 75% depending on raw water quality. System recovery is entirely dependent on water quality; higher
TDS or silt content will reduce the recovery rate and flow rates.

PUMP
The Grundfos CM range of horizontal multistage pumps are high efficiency, high quality products designed for continuous duty in various water
boosting and transfer applications. They are of compact dimensions, feature axial suction and radial discharge ports and are exceptionally quiet
in operation. The suction and outlet chambers are made of grey cast iron, the impeller and the impeller housing of 304 stainless steel.
The pumps are available in a wide range of sizes to suit particular applications and are designed for operation with the Grundfos PMI pump
controller which provides automatic operation according to demand as well as dry-run propection.
MOTOR
The pump is coupled to a totally enclosed, fan cooled Grundfos squirrel-cage motor. Single phase motors include a built in thermal overload
protection and should be connected to mains power through a 10A fuse or MCB. Three phase motors should be installed with a remote starter.

Solar Ioniser
Dayliff Solar Ioniser is a solar powered water purifier specially designed to control
algae growth in a simple, non-toxic and cost effective way, the main applications
being swimming pools, fish ponds, water gardens and water features. The unit
features two copper electrodes, one a peripheral coil and the other a central
sacrificial rod which erodes over time and with use. It floats on the water and works
when exposed to sunlight, an electrical current being generated by the surface 3W,
6V PV solar panel.
This causes electrolytic action that results in release of copper and other ions which
prevent the growth of microorganisms. The result is high quality pool water with
little maintenance, though trace quantities of chlorine should be periodically
applied to maintain sanitization levels. The unit is suitable for pool sizes up to
100m3 capacity. The great benefit of the Solar Ioniser is that it continuously treats
the pool water whenever there is sunshine, even when a pool cover is fitted. Apart
from periodic electrode replacement the unit will work for many years and at no
cost keeping pool water crystal clear.

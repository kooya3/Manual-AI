PUMP
DAYLIFF DS submersible pumps are designed for a wide range of uses with a particular application to borehole supply. They are of
multistage centrifugal impeller design and all parts are made from premium AISI304 stainless steel with water lubricated rubber
bearings. A submersible motor is fitted beneath the pump and suction is effected through a strainer between the pump and motor.
MOTOR
The pump is coupled to a sealed liquid cooled 2-pole asynchronous squirrel-cage motor constructed of stainless steel. Single phase
motors should be supplied with purpose designed Dayliff SCM control boxes for operation and protection against overload, dry
running and over/under voltage. Three phase motors require a remote DOL starter; A DAYLIFF SCT electronic Pump Controller is
recommended for comprehensive pump control including low level, motor overload and irregular power supply protection.

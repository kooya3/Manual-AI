SUPERPRESS
CONTROLLER

High specification in-line electronic pump controllers for automatic operation of pressurised water supplies.
Features include:• Starts pump on pressure or through the flow sensor (minimum 1.5litres/min)and stops on low flow. The
controller automatically senses the pipe pressure and regulates the starting pressure
• Dry run protection provided and restart when supply returns (positive suction)
• Incorporates a spring activated hydraulic accumulator to control pump cycling
• LED power on, pump run, dry run indicators and delay timer
• Settable delay timer for tank filling (P)
• Built in pressure gauge for pressure monitoring (P)

A high specification in-line electronic pump controller that starts on pressure and stops on either low flow or a
settable pressure. It completely replaces the traditional pressure tank/pressure switch systems whilst providing
a number of additional control features. These include:• Simple start and stop pressure setting with digital pressure display.
• Dry run protection
• Motor over current providing protection against overload and blocked water conditions.
• Options of master/slave configuration in twin booster set application and auto change-over.
• Operating/error status indicator via LED’s and display alerts.
• Input and output terminals for remote connection.
• Rotor anti-blocking function used to prevent seizure of mechanical parts during prolonged periods of
pump inactivity.

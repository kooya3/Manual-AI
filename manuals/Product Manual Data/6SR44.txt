PUMP
Pedrollo 6SR44 submersible pumps are specifically designed for supply from boreholes, though can also be used in other
submersible applications in either vertical or horizontal configuration. They feature a hydraulic design that incorporates floating
impellers which together with especially resistant component materials provide high resistance to sand content in the pumped water.
The pump impellers and diffusers are made from technopolymer while the stage casings, top housing, suction connector, pump
sleeve and shaft are made of AISI 304 stainless steel. The pump is supplied with a 4m tail cable.
MOTOR
Pumps are coupled to a two pole sealed motor constructed principally from stainless steel. Motors require a remote direct in-line
starter and if irregular electrical supply is prevalent an additional quick tripping multi function protection relay is recommended.

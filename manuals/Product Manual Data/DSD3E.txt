PUMP
Dayliff DSD3E submersible Multistage centrifugal pumps are specially designed for domestic and small scale water supply from
wells and boreholes. Material of construction include composite impellers and diffusers, cast iron delivery and suction chambers
and AISI 304 stainless steel pump sleeve, shaft and shaft coupling. These corrosion resistant materials together with the advanced
hydraulic design provide the pumps with excellent sand handling capabilities for a longer life and operational efficiency. The
pumps are supplied complete with 30m cable.
MOTOR
The pump is coupled to a sealed liquid cooled 2-pole asynchronous squirrel-cage motor constructed of stainless steel. Motors are
supplied complete with inbuilt capacitor and electrical overload protection. They can be connected directly to mains power supply
through fused insulation or MCB.

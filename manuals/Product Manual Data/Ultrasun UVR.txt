Ultrasun UVR VacRod Solar Hot Water Heaters provide highly effective water heating in small and medium residential applications. They
feature a series of glass heat pipes that consist of two sealed concentric glass tubes with a vacuum created in the void between to aid
efficient heat transfer. A copper rod is inserted into the inner tube void which projects into a header manifold, the void being filled with
water to optimise heat transfer and sealed at its end. The consumption water flows through the manifold and is heated by the projecting
copper rod. This water continuously circulates through the storage tank on the thermosyphon principal thus heating the tank contents. The
process is extremely effective and has the benefits of being suitable for lightly pressurized systems and also can be used with mineralized
water. Particular features of the systems are:• Double layered borosilicate glass vacuum tube with clear outer layer and an inner layer specially coated f o r m a x i m u m s o l a r

irradiation absorption.
• Storage tank comprising heavy duty stainless steel SU316 inner cylinder with external insulated painted steel casing and fitted with a

thermostat controlled electric heating element. The electric heater automatically switches when there is insufficient solar irradiation.
• Aluminium header manifold for heat transfer.
• Anodised aluminium frame.
• Five year guarantee for the tank and heating tubes.

Ultrasun UVR VacRod heaters are highly efficient and effective products designed for various installation conditions including pressurized
direct supply and mineralized input water. They are manufactured to the highest standards and will give many years of free hot water and
trouble-free operation.

PUMP
PEDROLLO FUTURE JET pumps are of centrifugal self-priming with improved jet design to provide highly efficient suction performance in
various domestic, small scale water boosting and irrigation applications. The integral ejector design enables the pump to handle water
with air without damaging the pump. They are particularly suited for in-ground installations, especially when fitted to an automatic control
unit. Material of construction is cast iron pump body with epoxy electro coating treatment for JSW1 and Cast Iron for JSW2, noryl ejectors
and AISI 304SS impeller.
FUTURE JET, is an innovative development of the classic jet pumps capable of developing the same pressure at double the capacity of its
predecessor with up to 50% reduction in energy consumption .
MOTOR
Pumps are close coupled to TEFC brushless induction motors designed for continuous operation. A thermal relay is provided in the
windings to protect against electrical and mechanical overload. Motors can be connected directly to the mains power supply through a
10A fuse or MCB.

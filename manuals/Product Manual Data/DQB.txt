PUMP
The DAYLIFF DQB is a revolutionary variable speed controlled circulator pump designed for hot water circulation in heating, cooling and solar
applications. Particular features include:
• Variable Speed inverter technology that enables the pump to selectively operate on a constant curve, proportional pressure where
pressure is adjusted according to heat demand and constant pressure where pressure remains constant irrespective of system demand.
• Efficient liquid cooled and leak proof motor ensuring longevity and quiet operation
• Intelligent pump with various operating modes adaptable to different applications and with comprehensive motor protection
• Display indicating power consumption and flow as well as alarm and warning conditions.
Pump construction is Aluminum motor housing, cast iron pump body, stainless steel rotor and Polyethersulfone impeller. Pumps are supplied
complete with flanges
MOTOR
The pump is fitted with an integral 4-pole asynchronous permanent-magnet high efficiency inverter controlled motor. The pump should be
connected to a suitably rated MCB or fuse.

Density:1560gms/L
Packaging: 50Kgs (1cu ft)

Glass Media

Environmentally friendly
media made from recycled
glass as a direct replacement
to sand media. Removes up
to 30% more sediments than
sand saving on backwashing.
Being less dense than sand, it
requires 15% less material to
fill an equivalent filter.

Activated Carbon

Medium activity granular
activated carbon
manufactured from coconut
shell. Its enhanced
microporosity makes it well
suited for the removal of low
molecular weight organic
compounds and cholrinated by
products. Other features
include excellent adsorption
capacity, high volume activity,
rapid dechlorination and low
filtered water turbidity.

such as chlorine
and ozone from

Silica sand based catalytic water
filtration media that utilizes
oxidation, adsorption and
filtration process to remove
impurities. Due to the infused
technology, DMI65 has the
advantage of longer life and
removes the chance of chemical
leaching into the water stream as
compared to other catalytic water
filtration media.

Everzit® N
Anthracite

A filtration media of hard coal with
the highest carbon content and
fewest impurities of all coal types. It
has lower specific gravity than sand
and glass media allowing it to be
used in dual-media filtration as the
coarse media at the top of the bed,
together with finer sand or glass
media at the bottom of the bed,
making “deep bed filtration”
possible. Dual-media filtration
gives a filter bed higher retention of
solids and longer running cycles.

PUMP
DAYLIFF DDWS is a PV solar powered submersible centrifugal closed impeller DC pump for water supply, irrigation and drainage
applications. Material of construction is aluminium impeller, cast iron pump body, double mechanical seal, NBR oil seal and
AISI301 stainless steel strainer and casing. Pumps feature an inbuilt controller that provides thermal protection, over/under voltage
protection, dry running protection, seizure and humidity protection and are supplied complete with 3m power cable and 1.5m solar
PV cable with MC4 connectors.
MOTOR
The pump is fitted with a permanent magnet DC brushless motor specifically designed for maximum efficiency from solar power.
The solar array must meet minimum input voltage required and it can be directly connected to the pump thRough an MCB isolator .
POWER OUTPUTS
Pump output curve is given at standard test conditions of 1000W/m2 solar irradiance and 250C. Output will vary throughout the
year depending upon prevailing irradiation levels. For estimated daily outputs at continuous pumping, multiply the indicated output
at the duty point by the daily radiation given in Graph 1. For indicative purposes, factors of 1.1 can be applied for hot arid areas and
0.9 for temperate high-altitude areas in the Tropics. Output will vary throughout the day as a proportion of the estimated hourly
irradiation as shown in Graph 2.

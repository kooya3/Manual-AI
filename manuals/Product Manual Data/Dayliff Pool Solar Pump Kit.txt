Solar pumping is now firmly established as the technology for water supply applications. Dayliff have been leaders in the
technology since the birth of the industry and today offer a huge range of options for every solar pumping requirement imaginable.
This technology is now being extended to Pool pumps which are easily powered through solar. The systems will use well designed
Inverter controller coupled to an array of PV panels for maximum application during the sunny hours which are adequate for pool
maintenance. A PV disconnect should be installed between PV and inverter for isolation of solar when not in use. An alternative
mains socket should be installed in the pumproom for optional use of mains power.
The pump performances as per the curves will largely apply though is advisable to take an 80-90% deviation which is normally
compensated by having the pump run for longer hours. During backwash, it is advisable to use mains power to get full speed on the
pump for a better filter clean up.

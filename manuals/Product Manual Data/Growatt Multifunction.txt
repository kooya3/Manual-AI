Multifunction Inverter

The Dayliff Growatt inverter range are versatile high specification multifunction inverters designed for various applications
including:• Grid Tie combining mains AC and PV module DC input power sources programmable to prioritise PV supply with mains
power used to supplement load requirements.
• Off-Grid for stand-alone PV solar powered systems to provide AC power for various load requirements with battery back up
for non PV availability.
• Power backup systems for on-grid mains failure battery feed loads.
The Dayliff Growatt inverters include the following features:• Pure sine wave output that provides filtered power for use with sensitive electronic devices.
• LCD display for operating parameters and user configurable settings including battery charging current, AC/Solar output
priority and input voltages.
• Built-in smart charge controllers with automatic switching between AC and Solar power sources for optimised battery

performance.
• Built-in MPPT charge controller
• Overload and short-circuit protection.
• Programmable supply prioritisation for PV, battery or grid supply
• Optional WIFI/GPRS for Monitoring software for real time status display and control
• Parallel operation for scalability available on 5000W model only
• Compatible with lead acid and lithium battery

Heat Pumps

Most swimming pools are not useable throughout the year especially during the cold weather and therefore heating is required. A
particularly effective solution is a Dayliff Heat Pump that utilises energy from two sources, heat from the ambient air and electric power to
run a compressor in a reverse refrigeration cycle, the compression process extracting heat from the ambient air for transfer to the pool
through a heat exchanger. The models are highly efficient operating at a Coefficient of Performance (COP), which is the ratio of energy
output to direct energy input of up to a range 7-15 units, depending on environmental conditions.
The advanced SPI inverter controlled models feature DC inverter technology which provides variable heat outputs from 20% to 100% of
capacity. They are more economical to run compared to fixed capacity alternatives as the heat output is automatically varied according to
requirements to maintain a set temperature.
The models include an integral controller and durable weatherproof housing suitable for outdoor installation. For optimal performance it
is recommended that a pool cover is used to reduce heat dissipated through evaporation.
Particular features include:• High efficiency, low noise Mitsubishi compressor that uses environmentally friendly R32 refrigerant
• Advanced dual coil titanium heat exchanger for long corrosion free life
• Remote controller to set temperature up to 400C with digital system settings and fault indicators with WiFi enabled remote control
• Built in protection for low water flow, high and low pressure and electrical overload
• Fully automatic and simple to install on the filter return to pool pipe with minimum plumbing and electrical connections
• All models suitable for reverse cooling configuration
The Dayliff range of heat pumps are robust and efficient units that are the ideal solution for cost effective swimming pool heating in a variety
of conditions.

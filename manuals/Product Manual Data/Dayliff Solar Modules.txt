The heart of all effective photovoltaic systems is an efficient and reliable solar module and there are none better than Dayliff PV
Modules. All are sourced directly from leading global PV module manufacturers who comply with the highest standards of quality
and durability and offer the following features:• High efficiency mono crystalline solar cells with maximum efficiency of 21.6% to provide maximum power even at low
irradiation levels
• High transmission rate tempered glass with an anti-reflection coating to increase the power output and provide mechanical
strength.
• Multi function water proof junction box for easy connection.
• 25 year power output warranty.
• Global Certification.
Modules are sourced from world leading PV module manufacturers principally Trina, Longi, Topray and Amerisolar who are all
large scale vertically integrated manufacturers that process from silicon production to module assembly to ensure consistently high
quality levels. Module types are recognised as quality products and are internationally certified by TUV Rheinland to ISO, CE and
IEC standards as follows.
All Dayliff modules are manufactured to the highest standards and are guaranteed to provide reliable performance over long life
spans. They are quality products in terms of both technology and performance and are ideal power sources for all types of solar
applications.

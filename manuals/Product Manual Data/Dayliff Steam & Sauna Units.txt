Note that for optimal performance of a sauna or steam room the cubicle must be correctly sized, suitably lined, insulated and adequately vented. Design parameters
are given in the manufacturer's literature. The cubicle height should be maintained and not more than 2100mm.
Electrical power must be supplied via an appropriately sized cable and installations must be provided with an earth leakage circuit breaker and suitably rated fuses or
MCB. Units must also be properly earthed and should be installed by a qualified electrician.

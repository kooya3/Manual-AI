Water Purifier
Cartridges
Clear, pure water is one of the most important requirements for good health, though many domestic supplies, even from municipal
sources, do not reach accepted standards of quality. Simple, effective and economical water treatment is therefore becoming
increasingly important, a requirement the Dayliff range of products have been specifically designed to fulfill. Dayliff is a leading
brand of domestic filtration equipment offering a complete range of filter bodies and cartridges to provide treatment for most
common water conditions. The products are proven and are the ideal solution for the majority of small-scale treatment applications
where clear, pure and safe water is demanded.
CARTRIDGES

SEDIMENT REMOVAL
Wound Polypropylene Yarn: The standard cartridge for removal of sediment and particles down to the specified mesh size.
Suitable for solvents, oils, acids, alkalis and brine as well as other potable liquids. Available in 1,5, 10, 25 and 50 micron meshes.
Spun Polypropylene: The melt-blown polypropylene fibres provide a homogenous material structure and are ideal for ultrapure filtration applications to 5micron where leaching of filter material must be avoided.
Pleated Polypropylene: Made from pleated polypropylene, these cartridges are ideal for high flow potable water applications
due to the enlarged filtration surface area. They provide fine sediment filtration of between 0.22 and 0.45 micron and are ideal for
final polishing filtration before UV treatment.
BACTERIA REMOVAL
Ceramic: The finely pored ceramic diatomaceous material provides ultra-filtration to 0.9 micron for the removal of fine particles
and is particularly suitable for the removal of micro-organisms and bacteria thus reducing the risk of water borne diseases. Particles
are retained on the cartridge surface, which can be cleaned by scrubbing.
TASTE/ODOUR/CHEMICAL REMOVAL
Granular Activated Carbon: A granular activated carbon filter using acid washed coconut shell based activated carbon and
suitable for the removal of chlorine, organic chemicals, insecticides, pesticides and herbicides as well as unpleasant taste and
odours.
Dual Sediment/Carbon: A standard polypropylene sediment cartridge combined with a carbon core providing two-stage
filtration for the removal of particles, chlorine, organic chemicals, taste and odours. Available in 5 micron specification.
Softening Resin: A food-grade resin filled cartridge for small-scale water softening application by ion exchange. For optimal
operation it is recommended that the softener cartridge is used in a twin body configuration with a 5 micron first stage pre-filter.

Pedrollo PRO-DG is a inverter-based electronic controller for surface and submersible pumps of up to 11kW for commercial, industrial
and agricultural applications and can be installed in either wall or frame mounted configuration. It provides extended system lifespan and
significant energy savings while protecting pumps from dry running, overcurrent, overheating, phase loss and motor faults. It can work
simultaneously with other controllers and manage up to 8 pumps in a cascade sequence, with RS485 communication. A display and
keypad enables an easy and intuitive configuration of basic operating parameters, including system pressure, operating frequency,
absorbed current and alarm messages through a start-up wizard consisting of a few simple steps. Features include:
• Easy Programming and adjustment
• Constant pressure in the system
• Energy conservation
• Reduced noise operation
• Communication of up to eight devices
• Intelligent intervention management in case of anomalies
• Model TT 3-30 includes motor temperature probe input, 0-10V input and Modbus communication
• Compatible with a wide variety of pumps

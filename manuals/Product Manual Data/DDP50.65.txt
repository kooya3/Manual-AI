PUMP
The DAYLIFF DDP range of pumps are robust and efficient automatic pressure controlled peripheral impeller booster pumps suitable for
domestic and small scale applications where on-demand water supply is required. The pumps are self priming and are equipped with a
diaphragm type pressure vessel and pressure control to provide fully automatic operation. DDP50A incorporates mechanical pressure
control start and stop while DDP65A incorporates an electronic microprocessor that starts and stops the pump automatically, provides dry
running protection, auto re-start and controls cycling.
Pump construction is a cast iron body with stainless steel insert on the wearing surface and brass impeller.
MOTOR
The pump is close-coupled to a single-phase motor designed for continuous operation and is provided with a thermal cutout to protect
against electrical overload. It can be connected directly to the mains power supply through a 5A fuse or MCB.

PUMP
DAYLIFF DSX submersible pumps featuring permanent magnet motors are specifically designed for water supply from boreholes.
Equipped with a high specification intelligent variable frequency controller and operating at high frequency they offer unmatched
efficiency and much reduced size. Materials of construction are engineering polymer impeller and diffuser and AISI304 stainless
steel for top and bottom chambers, pump sleeve and shaft.
MOTOR
Permanent magnet synchronous motor uses special magnetised materials which generate a higher flux density that greatly
improves efficiency and power factor. Operating at 5000 RPM the rated motor current is about 85% of an equivalent synchronous
motor with the motor efficiencies of up to 90%.
CONTROLLER
The pump is provided with a remote intelligent variable frequency controller with features that include digital parameter indication,
soft start, IoT (Internet of Things) control facility, electrical protection from high/low voltage, motor current overload and phase loss
and dry run protection. The IoT capability provides various functionalities including remote control, real time monitoring, operating
status recording and fault alarm record. Pumps can be monitored and controlled through GSM connected mobile phones.
DAYLIFF DSX submersible pumps feature revolutionary motor design that provides up to 15% improvement in energy efficiency,
about 50% reduced sizes and improved reliability through enhanced motor control. They offer quite unmatched operational
performance and are the new frontier in pumping technology.

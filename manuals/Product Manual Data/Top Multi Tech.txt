PUMP
Pedrollo TOP MULTI-TECH are centrifugal multistage submersible pumps featuring closed impellers with a particular application for pumping
from wells and water boosting from tanks. They feature excellent motor cooling performance due to the jacketed motor design enabling the pump
to operate continuously partially submerged. Other innovative features include double mechanical seals with intermediate oil chamber for total
motor sealing and simple design for ease of maintenance. Pump construction is fiberglass reinforced technopolymer pump body and suction filter
with Noryl impellers and diffusers.
TOP MULTI-TECH also feature a built in automatic Electronic Controller to provide water on demand with the following features;
• Starts on pressure below 1.5Bar for Multi-Tech 2 and 2.5bar for Multi-Tech 4 and stops on flow (<3 l/min).
• Protects against dry run with auto restart. In the event of dry running the pump will make 3 ON/OFF tests as a confirmation before stopping to
prevent damage. The pump will then re-start after 3 minutes and, if there is still no water will make further attempts at double time intervals up
to 50 hours. After this the pump will stop completely and must be manually reset by disconnecting the power and re-connecting.
• To avoid seizure during long periods of inactivity, the pump will start and run for approximately 10 seconds every 48 hours.
• The maximum vertical distance between the pump and the highest outlet point (tap) is 10m for Top Multi-Tech 2 and 20m for Top Multi-Tech
4. Exceeding this limit will prevent the system from operating efficiently.
For optimal performance and prevention of auto cycling, it is advisable to fit 1 litre pressure tank on the delivery line, before the first tap, with a precharge pressure of 1.2Bar (Multi-Tech 2) and 2.2Bar (Multi-Tech 4). A non-return valve should not be installed on the pipes.
MOTOR
Pumps are provided with built-in non overloading induction motors designed for continuous operation. A thermal cut-out is provided in the motor
windings to protect against pump overload. Pumps can be connected directly to the mains power supply through a 10Amps fuse or MCB.

Pure water is an essential requirement for healthy living and there is ever increasing awareness of the dangers from contaminated supply. Treatment by Ultra
Violet light is a proven and highly effective method of eliminating harmful bacteria from drinking water supplies using Ultraviolet light rays. The process has
many advantages including no chemical additions to the water, negligible operating costs and security being both inherently safe and impossible to
overdose. It works on the principal that UV light at a specific wavelength emit UV-C rays which are lethal to infectious micro-organisms as they destroys their
ability to reproduce and thus renders them harmless. The process protects against most types of bacteria including legionella, salmonella, faecal coliform,
e-coli, influenza, hepatitis and dysentery bacilli and is one of the safest and easiest ways to provide pure, sanitised drinking water.
Using this effective technology DAYLIFF Sita UV Purifiers have been carefully designed to incorporate all the benefits of the process into reliable and
effective treatment packages particularly applicable for smaller commercial, institutional and domestic applications. Design UV-C dosage at the rated
flows is approximately between 300J/m2 – 400J/m2, a rate of 300J/m2 being sufficient to destroy most common forms of bacteria. Particular features
include:• AISI 304 stainless steel treatment chamber with an effective sleeve sealing arrangement that is simple to disassemble for sleeve cleaning and lamp
maintenance.
• High purity quartz lamp sleeve.
• High efficiency 254nm wavelength UV mercury vapour quartz lamps.
• Domestic AL series purifiers include an in-built controller for direct mains supply connection that features a fault/working LED indicator.
• LCD and Rack series purifiers include a separate microprocessor controller that features an LCD display of lamp working hours, operating status
and faults, countdown hour meter, alarm indicator and relay for remote monitoring, remote on/off relay and timer.
DAYLIFF Sita UV Purifiers provide all the benefits of the UV treatment process in effective, economical treatment units that can be relied on for years of
trouble free operation. Whenever there is a requirement for clean, pure water there is no other better solution than a Sita UV Purifier.
RAW WATER QUALITY
The effectiveness of UV treatment is determined by the clarity of the incoming water as suspended particles and discolouration can shield the micro
organisms from the UV light. It is therefore of the greatest importance that the incoming supply is adequately pre-treated to ensure effective treatment, the
following criteria being required:
Clarity: <5NTU

Suspended Solids: <10ppm, Magnesium <0.05ppm, Iron<0.3ppm

pH: 6.5-9.5

LAMP LIFE
UV lamps lose approx 6% intensity every 1000hrs operation so to maintain effective dosage lamps must be changed after a maximum of 9000hrs
operation (approximately one year of continuous usage).

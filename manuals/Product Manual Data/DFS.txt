Pumps

DAYLIFF DFS Fire Hose Reel pump sets are specifically designed for the automatic operation of hose reels in commercial and
industrial buildings. All systems are rated at 4Bar and various sizes are available with single or twin pump options. Systems include
the following components:• High performance Dayliff DB multistage horizontal stainless steel booster pumps. Grundfos CM/Pedrollo alternatives are
available on request.
• Electronic Dayliff Drytek (one pump) and Smart Pro (twin pump) controllers that include pump protection functions. Twin
pump sets are connected for parallel operation with the second pump set to operate at higher demand conditions.
• Low maintenance GWS diaphragm type pressure tank incorporating a special diaphragm and air valve design that
eliminates air leaks and the need for regular maintenance. This is especially important for fire systems that can remain
unused for long periods of time.

pump piping and valves for simple site installation.

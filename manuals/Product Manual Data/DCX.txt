PUMP
The DAYLIFF DCX range of portable high pressure pumps are of self priming closed impeller centrifugal type specially designed for
high head water transfer, fire fighting and irrigation applications. Pumps are fitted with one or two impellers for medium or high
pressure flow performance and are available with either petrol or diesel engines.
Pump construction is high grade aluminium body and impellers and pumps are supplied with quick couple suction and inlet
connectors and a strainer. A sturdy carrying and protection frame is also provided.
ENGINE
Engine options are available as follows:Petrol
4-stroke OHV single cylinder air cooled design with transistorised ignition, built in oil alert and recoil start.
Diesel
4-stroke OHV single cylinder diesel injection air cooled design with recoil start.
Note that performance curves for all engines relate to the engine governor set at maximum speed to achieve maximum rated power
output. To prolong engine life pumps should only be run under maximum power conditions for short periods and for extended duty
the throttle setting should be reduced to approximately three-quarters power. Pump performance will then be reduced accordingly.

PUMP
Pedrollo DAVIS peripheral impeller submersible pumps are designed for pumping clean water in domestic applications from
boreholes and wells. They are based on the established 4SKm design though are much improved featuring a cast stainless steel
pump housing with special anti-seize design, double mechanical seals to prevent water leakage in to the motor and built in thermal
overload for motor protection.
All components in contact with water are manufactured from stainless steel with the impeller being made of brass. The motor
capacitor is integral with the pump and no separate control unit is required. Pumps are supplied with 20m or 40m of drop cable to
customer choice.
MOTOR
All pumps are fitted with hermetically sealed re-windable liquid cooled induction motors designed for continuous duty provided the
pump is fully submerged. They should be connected directly to mains supply through a 10A MCB or switch fuse.

PUMP
The PEDROLLO CP range are non self-priming closed impeller pumps with integral motors. They are efficient, quiet and rated for
continuous duty making them suitable for water boosting and transfer in a variety of domestic, industrial and agricultural
applications. They are also particularly suited to automatic pressurised supply using either a surge tank or 'Presscontrol' unit.
Pump construction material is cast iron for the casing and brass alloy for impellers.
Pumps can be installed for manual or automatic control using either the unique ‘Presscontrol’ unit or a pressure tank and switch.
Cpm 158 is available with the ‘Hydrofresh’ option combines a 24L horizontal diaphragm tank, pressure switch and gauge with
pressure settings of 1.8Bar for pump start and 3.2 ar for pump stop.
MOTOR
Pumps are close coupled to a Pedrollo brushless TEFC induction motor designed for continuous operation. Single phase motors
are provided with a thermal cutout in the windings to protect against electric and mechanical overload and can be connected
directly to the mains power supply through a 10Amp fuse or MCB. Three phase motors require remote DOL starter protection
according to local regulations.

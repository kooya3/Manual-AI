Variable speed control is a widely used technology for pump control & works by varying the pump speed to provide system water output at a constant
pressure. Smart Inverter booster sets feature an integrated variable speed inverter drive within a permanent magnet motor. This provides the
following benefits:
• Constant pressure providing consistent, even supply to the consumer.
• Large energy cost savings as systems are always operating at peak efficiency for the demand conditions.
• Extended pump life due to reduced electrical and mechanical operating loads.
• Silent operation with no pressure shocks
• Simplified installation due to compact dimensions and integral pump control with no separate control panel needed
Principle system components include an integral variable speed controller, a quality Dayliff pump, a pressure sensor and a surge tank that smoothens
the operating cycle. The integral controllers offer the following features;
• Varies pump speed to maintain a pre-set system pressure.
• Over voltage, under voltage, single phasing and electrical overload protection.
• Dry run protection with auto restart.
• Integral soft start/stop function which extends pump life, reduces system pressure loads and
reduces mains power loading on start up.
• Master-Slave controller configurations and sychronization of multiple controller systems for
sequenced pump operation.
• Balanced pump operation ensuring equalized operating periods for each system pump.

All Dayliff Smart inverter booster sets use the latest technology controllers integrated into a quality
Dayliff pump and are supplied frame mounted complete with inlet, outlet manifolds and valves
for simple installation. Nominal system pressures can be set to suit site conditions and multiple
pump configurations are available. Variable speed technology is now accepted as the most
efficient way to provide on-demand water supply in all sorts of industrial, commercial and
domestic applications. Dayliff smart inverter booster sets are the ideal solution in the application
of this efficient technology.

Smartflo interprets the signal from the
pressure transducer and varies pump speed
to maintain constant set pressure at various
demand levels.

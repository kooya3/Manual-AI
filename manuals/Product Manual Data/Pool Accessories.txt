s w i m m i n g
pleasure either by
providing no lap
swimming exercise or for underwater massage. The units
comprise a jet assembly adjustable for strength and direction
mounted in the pool wall powered by a remote Dayliff Jetspa
pump that is provided with a safe pneumatic control switch.
Kits include the jet body with niche for wall mounting, massage
and air hoses and control switch. In addition a separately
supplied Jetspa 3KW jet pump and inter-connecting piping
and valves are required.

iSaverX

The Dayliff iSaverX is a frequency converter
that varies the speed of pool pump motor. The
effect of speed changes is to reduce the
running cost up to 75% of the pool pump
rating since normal filtration does not
necessarily need high speed. The pump will
be much quieter offering ecofriendly
performance and offers longer life span due
to working in lower speeds.
The controller has 3 default speeds at
1400,2000 and 2900rpm but there are
options of 3 settable speeds for 24hr
operation. The controllers offer error codes
referred in the operation manual for
troubleshooting. An RS485 Modbus
communication capability is provided.

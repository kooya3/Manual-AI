PUMP
Dayliff DFP sanitary pumps are of single stage centrifugal impeller specifically designed to meet the hygiene requirements of sterile
operating processes. They are suitable for various applications including water supply systems, pressure boiler feeding, pure water
treating systems, pharmaceutical, food and refining chemical industries. The design features optimised hydraulics for high
efficiency and polished internal finishes to prevent fouling by bacteria and germs. Pump hydraulic end construction is AISI 316L
stainless steel throughout with specialised mechanical seal that can handle hot pumped media.
MOTOR
Pumps are close coupled to reliable TEFC electric motors designed for continuous duty. Single phase motors have integral thermal
protection and can be connected directly to the mains power through a 10A fuse or MCB. Three phase motors require a remote
DOL starter.

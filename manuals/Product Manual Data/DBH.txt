PUMP
The Dayliff DBH range of horizontal multistage centrifugal pumps are designed for continuous duty in various water transfer duties
with particular application in pumping slightly corrosive liquids. The pump has small physical dimensions, axial suction port and
radial discharge and is base plate mounted. The pump body, suction and discharge ports are made from AISI 316 stainless steel as
is all the other parts in contact with the pumped liquid. The mechanical seal is made from silicon carbide designed for easy
replacement. Both pump and continuously rated motor unit are of monoblock design and particular attention has been paid to
quietness and smooth operation.
MOTOR
The pump is coupled to a totally enclosed, fan cooled single phase squirrel-cage motor with built in thermal overload protection
suitable for continuous duty. The motor can be connected to a power outlet fuse or MCB and protection must be provided.

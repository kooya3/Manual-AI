The DAYLIFF DDT pump is of single stage centrifugal impeller self priming design suitable for small scale irrigation, water boosting
and water transfer applications. Material of construction are stainless shaft, UV-proof composite material for the pump body and all
hydraulic components in contact with water are made of engineering plastic.
MOTOR
Pumps are close coupled to reliable TEFC electric motors designed for continuous operation and are provided with a thermal cut
out to protect against electrical overload. They can be connected directly to the mains power supply through a 10A fuse or MCB.

PUMP
DAB DTRON/ESYBOX DIVER pumps are advanced technology smart submersible boosters especially designed for in tank water supply
applications. All models feature an integral electronic controller providing for fully automatic operation as follows:DTRON features a fixed speed motor that stops on pressure set at 2.4Bar fixed for DTRON2 and settable for DTRON3 and starts on flow
ESYBOX DIVER is fitted with a variable speed permanent magnet motor that maintains a constant system pressure pre-set at 3Bar though
adjustable from 1 to 5.5Bar.
All pumps include the following features:• Pump design incorporates a double mechanical seal, non-return valve and bleed valve for reliable priming
• Integral expansion vessel to minimise cycling and protect against water hammer for extended life. A separate pressure vessel is not
necessary
• Adjustable suction height up to 8 centimetres
• Can be configured for horizontal, vertical, external (with additional suction chamber), submerged, semi submerged and for
surface suction (with additional float kit) installation arrangements
• Integral high efficiency motors incorporating dry run and motor overload protection
• Incorporate a remote DCONNECT controller that provides for wireless level control and pump operation monitoring through WiFi smartphone connection
Materials of construction and non-corroding Technopolymer throughout and 15 metres of cable with quick coupling is included.
DAB DTRON/ESYBOX DIVER pumps are complete water boosting systems and require no further accessories. The submersible design
ensures simplicity of installation, reliability, quiet operation and security and they are an optimal solution for all small scale water supply
applications.

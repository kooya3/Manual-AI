PUMP
The DAYLIFF DCT range of portable diesel engine pumps are of self-priming centrifugal type specially designed for pumping waste
water with high silt loads with applications in construction site drainage, sewage abstraction, flood drainage etc. Pumps are fitted
with open vane type impellers for enhanced solid passing performance and are also provided with an easy opening front casing for
volute cleaning incase of blockage. Both models are powered by reliable and economic diesel engines.
For all pumps the body and impellers are manufactured from high grade aluminum. The DCT80D is provided with a sturdy carrying
and protection frame while the DCT150D is wheel mounted
ENGINE
4 stroke OHV, direct injection air cooled design fitted with oil alert protection.
Note that performance curves for all engines relate to the engine governor set at maximum speed to achieve maximum rated power
output. To prolong engine life pumps should only be run under maximum power conditions for short periods and for extended duty
the throttle setting should be reduced to approximately three-quarters power. Pump performance will then be reduced accordingly.

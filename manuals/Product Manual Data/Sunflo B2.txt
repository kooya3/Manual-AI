PUMP
DAYLIFF SUNFLO-B2 pumps are specifically designed for PV solar powered water supply from wells and boreholes. They are of centrifugal design
and material of construction incude polycarbonate impellers and diffusers, cast iron delivery and suction chambers and AISI 304 stainless steel
pump housing, shaft and shaft coupling. Pumps are supplied complete with an MPPT controller.
MOTOR
Permanent magnet, oil filled, brushless, DC motor specifically designed for maximum efficiency from solar module power sources. It should be
powered by a solar array configured to provide the input voltage required and sized at approximately 130% of the rated motor power
Enclosure Class: IP68

Insulation Class: F

Speed:3000rpm

CONTROLLER
The pump is supplied with a seperate multifunction MPPT (Maximum Power Point Tracking) controller that tracks the solar module's maximum
power output voltage which varies with module temperature and irradiation levels. This ensures maximum current output, typically +25% higher
than conventional module controllers and a similar increase in daily water output. The controller also protects from over and under voltage, over
current and low water level and features various indicator lights that give the pump’s operating status. The system can be installed either with or
without batteries. If batteries are included, the pump will operate when there is insufficient solar irradiation for direct power.
PUMP OUTPUTS
Pump output curve is given at standard test conditions of 1000W/m solar irradiance and 250C. Output will vary throughout the year depending
upon prevailing irradiation levels. For estimated daily outputs at continuous pumping, multiply the indicated output at the
duty point by the daily radiation given in Graph 1. For indicative purposes, factors of 1.1 can be applied for hot arid areas
and 0.9 for temperate high-altitude areas in the Tropics. Output will vary throughout the day as a proportion of the
estimated hourly irradiation as shown in Graph 2.
OPERATING PARAMETERS
Pumped Liquid: Thin, clean, chemically non-aggressive liquids with a maximum particle size of 2.3mm
Max. Liquid Temperature: +350C
Max Immersion Depth: 100m

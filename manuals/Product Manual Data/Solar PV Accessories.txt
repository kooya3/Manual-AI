PV DISCONNECT

Specially designed for isolation of PV array strings from controllers or inverters in Photovoltaic (PV)
applications during operation and maintenance. They feature fast-acting DC Circuit Breakers that
protect installation against over currents and short-circuits on the DC side. When installed on each
string of a multi-string PV array, they also protect against reverse currents in the event of shading or
faults.
* Also applies to PV combiner and PV Protect

PV PROTECT

Features advanced Surge Protection for PV systems against transient overvoltage caused by
lightning discharges on the DC side. When the distance between inverter/controller and the PV
array is greater than 10m, it is advisable to install 2No units, one close to inverter/controller and
another close to array all suitably bonded and earthed.

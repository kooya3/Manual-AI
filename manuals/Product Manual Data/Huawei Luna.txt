The Huawei Luna 2000 Smart Power Supply Systems are of Grid-tie type suitable for intelligent hybrid DC PV solar/AC mains power supplies in
residential and small scale commercial applications as well as off grid applications. The basic systems comprise an integral battery and power
module with a separate inverter unit and is simple to install and operate. The system prioritises the PV power input, supported by surplus battery
output that is topped up by mains power to fulfil the demand load. Particular features include:•

Optimised PV power consumption to minimise mains power input.
Compatible with Single and 3 Phase Huawei Sun 2000 inverters with up to 10kW PV solar input supply
Available with an integral mains failure battery backup facility by the addition of a power status controller. This provides instant changeover
to standby power in the event of mains power shut down.
Advanced Lithium-iron-phosphate battery that provides long life and deep cycle discharge guaranteed for 16.45MWh per battery pack.
Remote phone or PC monitoring that gives detailed operating information including total power consumption, PV output and mains power
consumption on a daily, weekly or monthly basis enabling analysis of power loads to minimise mains power consumption.
Conditioned pure sine wave AC power output suitable for all electronic devices.
Available in three standard battery sizes of 5, 10 and 15 kW and single or three phase output supply. Systems can be paired to provide total
30 kWh battery capacity connecting to one inverter.

The Huawei Luna 2000 Power Systems are high efficiency state-of-the-art power supply solutions that provide optimised, reliable and consistent
power control that minimises energy costs.

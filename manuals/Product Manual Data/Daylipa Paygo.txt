DAYLIPA
PayGo

Daylipa PAYGO is a product financing service aimed at accelerating access to green energy solutions by providing solar pumping
solutions on an easy Pay-as-you go platform.
Flexible Repayment
Daylipa PAYGO offers customers a 2 year financing facility payable with an initial deposit and flexible regular monthly repayment
installments that are computed by a calculation of final and variable charge based on usage. The payments are made by
purchasing water pumping units via Mobile Money.
Remote Monitoring & Support
The heart of the system is a smart controller that monitors the operation of the pump and communicates with the Daylipa PAYGO
system. This enables the Daylipa team to identify any operation issues immediately they happen, and remotely resolve them or
deploy a technician from a network of service personnel nearest to the user. The smart controller also enables real time crediting of
water pumping units purchased to ensure uninterrupted pump operation providing due charges are paid.
Customer Mobile Application
Once onboarded onto the Daylipa platform, customers have access to a Daylipa PAYGO mobile Android app that allows users to:
• Monitor their solar water pump condition.
• Buy solar water pumping units.
• Control their pump by turning it On/Off at any time.
• View their financing balance and review payment transactions.
Wide Application Range
Daylipa PAYGO is available for a wide range of solar water pumps that can be chosen according to customer requirements.

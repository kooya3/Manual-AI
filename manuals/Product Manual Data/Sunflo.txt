Solar pumping is now firmly established as the technology for water supply in remote off-grid applications and also as the costs reduce increasingly for
general pumping duties. Dayliff have been leaders in the technology since the birth of the industry and today offer a wide range of options for every solar
pumping requirement imaginable. Particularly a range of competitive, high specification solar pumping systems have been developed for smaller scale
applications which are based on robust submersible solar pumps specially designed for PV powered water supply from wells and boreholes.
Together with the pump all systems include:• The appropriate specifications and number of Grade 1 PV modules with connectors for simplified installation
• Submersible drop cable and joint together with 10m module connection cable
• DC solar isolator with MCB control provided for module isolation
• Safety rope and HDPE pipe connectors
Module supports and piping are not included. The various systems offered give a wide range of duties, indicative performance being given. Full details of
pump performance and specification is given in the Dayliff Product Manual and should be referred to when selecting equipment.
SUNFLO-A

SUNFLO-S
Positive displacement type of three
chamber diaphragm design. They
are manufactured from high quality
engineering plastics with stainless
s t e e l c a s i n g . Pu m p s c a n b e
connected directly to a 24V PV power
supply for daytime only pumping or
through a charge controller
connected to batteries for extended
daily operation.

SUNFLO-B2
All models are of helical
rotary screw stainless
steel design for high
efficiency and feature an
inbuilt controller that
gives operating
protection for direct
connection to the PV
modules. All models are
of narrow 3” diameter
specifically designed for
boreholes.

Higher specification pumps
of both helical rotor and
centrifugal type that are
provided with separate
controllers that feature
MPPT technology to
maximise pumping output
as well as providing
electrical protection and
indicator lights giving
operating status. Battery
connection is also available
for extended daily pumping.

PUMP
GRUNDFOS Alpha2 is a revolutionary variable speed controlled circulator pump designed for hot water circulation in heating,
cooling and solar applications. The pump is provided with a number of unique features:

l

Variable Speed inverter technology that enables the pump to selectively operate on a constant curve, proportional pressure
where pressure is adjusted according to heat demand and constant pressure where pressure remains constant irrespective
of system demand.
Three selectable speeds so the pump performance can be matched to system requirements.
Fully automatic AUTOADAPT function which continuously adjusts pump output to system demand and thus optimises energy
consumption.
Display indicating power consumption and flow as well as alarm and warning conditions.

Pump construction is cast iron for the pump housing, stainless steel for the rotor can and composite plastic for the impeller. Pumps
are supplied complete with BSP union connections and insulating shells.
MOTOR
The pump is fitted with an integral 4-pole synchronous permanent-magnet high efficiency inverter controlled motor fitted with
thermal overload protection. The pump should be connected to a suitably rated MCB or fuse.

PUMP
The Dayliff DDPS range of solar powered booster pump are suitable for water transfer in small scale applications where grid power is unavailable.
Consturction is cast iron pump body, aluminium motor body, peripheral brass impeller and silicon carbide mechanical seal.
Pumps feature an inbuilt controller that provides thermal and over voltage protection and can be connected directly to a DC PV power supply.
They are supplied complete with 1m long PV cable with MC4 connection for quick and easy installation.
MOTOR
The pump is coupled to high efficiency permanent magnet brushless DC motor rated for continuous operation.
Enclosure Class: IP54

Insulation Class:B

Speed:2900rpm

POWER OUTPUTS
Pump output curves are given at standard test conditions of 1000W/m2 solar irradiance and 250C. Output will vary throughout the year
depending upon prevailing irradiation levels. For estimated daily outputs at continuous pumping, multiply the indicated output at the duty point by
the daily irradiation given in Graph 1. For indicative purposes, factors of 1.1 can be applied for hot arid areas and 0.9 for temperate high altitude
areas in the Tropics . Output will vary throughout the day as a proportion of the estimated hourly irradiation as shown in Graph 2.
OPERATING CONDITIONS
Pumped Liquid: Thin clean chemically non-aggressive liquid without solids or fibres.
Max. Ambient Temperature: +350C
Max. Liquid Temperature: +400C

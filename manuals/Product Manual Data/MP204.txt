Motor Protection Unit

The Grundfos MP204 is a state of art electronic motor protector for asynchronous motors and can be used with both single and
three phase motors. The unit consists of an enclosure incorporating instrument transformers and electronics and a control panel
with operating buttons and display for reading data. It offers motor protection against current and voltage irregularities, dry
running, earth leakage, high internal motor temperature and power factor. It also monitors harmonic distortion, starting and
running capacitances if used with a single phase motor and can be connected to an external PTC thermal cutout switch.
Particular features include:
• Tripping if a condition of overload, underload (dry run), high temperature, missing phase, wrong phase sequence,
overvoltage, undervoltage, low power factor or current unbalance is detected.
• Warning against overload, underload, high temperature, overvoltage, undervoltage, low power factor, low capacitance
(single phase), and harmonic distortion.
• A learning function that enables the unit to measure and store the phase sequence for three phase motors and the capacity
of the start and running capacitors for single phase motors.
• Accurate measurement of current and voltage by true RMS measurement sampling each cycle 256 times.
• Use of MI301control which allows adjustment of various factory settings, carry out service and trouble shooting and read
out data stored in the unit.

Grundfos MP204 unit is a high specification unit that provides comprehensive protection and allows monitoring and user
interaction. It is easy to install and set up and mounting is done by means of four screws or by sliding the unit onto a DIN mounting
rail. It handles currents up to 1000A, though at currents above 120A, current transformers must be used.

100-480 VAC, 50/60Hz

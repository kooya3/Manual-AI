COMPRESSOR
Mapro air blowers are high specification machines of side channel type fitted with centrifugal vane type impellers for applications
that require consistent high air flow at medium pressures. The rotating parts are not in contact with the casing and the compressed
air is therefore totally contaminant free. Other benefits include low noise levels, no vibration and pulsation free discharge. Material
of construction for the compressor is aluminium alloy for both the casing and the impellers and units are close coupled to flange
mounted electric motors.
MOTOR
Totally enclosed fan cooled motors complying to IEC specifications. Three phase motors must be connected to an effective motor
starter in accordance with local regulations. Single phase can be connected to a suitably rate MCB.
Enclosure Class: F (up to 3kW), H(4kW and above)

Protection Class: IP55

Speed: 2900rpm

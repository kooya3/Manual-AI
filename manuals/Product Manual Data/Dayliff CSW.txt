SCHEMATIC INSTALLATION LAYOUT

DAYLIFF CSW pumped circulation hot water systems are applicable in centralised distribution installations
where the tank is mounted remotely from the solar collectors instead of the integral thermosyphon alternative.
They can be used in small scale domestic systems and are also particularly applicable for larger systems
installed in institutions like schools, hotels and hospitals. Key features include:
• High efficiency Ultrasun Premium solar collectors which incorporate full area copper absorption plates
ultrasonically welded to copper circulation tubes, advanced specification insulation and tempered
security glass to provide energy absorption of up to 95%.
• Long life eco friendly Ultrasun Premium indirect single coil water storage tank made from low carbon steel with double enamel
internal coating and cathodic protection for exceptional corrosion protection. Tanks are also provided with powder coated steel
external casings with soft foam insulation and thermostat controlled heating elements (1x2kW up to 500L and 2x2kW for 1000L
to 2000L respectively) .
• High performance Grundfos Alpha2 25-60 speed controlled circulator pump available on request.
• An advanced programmable differential temperature controller manages operation of forced circulation solar systems. The
controller incorporates inputs from sensors that monitor temperature at various points in the system and relays signals to control the
circulation pump and thermostats to optimize hot water availability. It also includes a digital display indicator indicating the system
layout, hour counter for the circulator pump and system temperatures.
DAYLIFF CSW Hot Water system are available in various tank sizes and collector configurations to suit most
residential and institution applications and provide an efficient and effective solution to all pumped solar hot
water heating requirements.

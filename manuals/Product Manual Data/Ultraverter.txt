The Dayliff DUV Ultraverter High Frequency inverter range are versatile high specification multifunction inverters designed for various
applications including:• Grid Tie combining mains AC and PV module DC input power sources programmable to prioritise PV supply with mains power used to
supplement load requirements upto rated inverter power output.
• Off-Grid for stand-alone PV solar powered systems to provide AC power for various load requirements with battery back up for non PV
availability.
• Power backup systems for on-grid mains failure battery feed loads.
The inverters include the following features:• Pure sine wave output that provides filtered power for use with sensitive electronic devices.
• LCD display for operating parameters and user configurable settings including battery charging current, AC/Solar output priority and
input voltages.
• Built-in smart battery charger with automatic switching between AC and Solar power sources for optimised battery performance.
• Built-in MPPT solar charger
• Overload short-circuit protection and deep discharge protection
• Programmable supply prioritisation for PV, battery or grid supply
• Optional WIFI/GPRS for Monitoring software for real time status display and control
• Parallel operation for scalability available on 5200W model only, up to 3 units
• Compatible with lead acid and lithium battery
• Inverters require battery to operate

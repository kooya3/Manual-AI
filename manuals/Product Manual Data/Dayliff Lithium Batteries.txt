Lithium Iron Phosphate (LiFePO4) batteries with Battery Management System control are high-performance alternatives to the
conventional Lead Acid VRLA type with principal applications for solar power system storage and mains power supply backup. They
offer considerable benefits including enhanced power output, considerably extended life and cooler operation in high
temperatures and are especially suited to high specification installations. Particular benefits include:• 100% depth of discharge with a design life of up to 8000 cycles, 4 times the life of a comparable Lead Acid type
• Constant discharge voltage that enables the battery to deliver nearly full power until it is fully discharged. This also greatly
simplifies voltage regulation control.
• Lighter weight but higher energy density to similar capacity Lead Acid alternatives.
• Low self-discharge rate of 3% per month.
• Built in battery charge/discharge protection.
• Excellent resistance to over and under charge with no damaging effects.
• Maintenance free, totally safe and environmentally friendly.
• Batteries should only be connected in parallel. Series connection will result in battery damage.
In every aspect of performance Lithium Iron Phosphate batteries offer a much superior solution over the Lead Acid alternatives and
though of higher capital cost deliver the more economical long term outcome due to their greatly increased life, consistent power
output and better charge/discharge performance. For high specification systems where enhanced performance is demanded and
reliability is essential they are the optical choice.

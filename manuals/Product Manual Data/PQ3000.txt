PUMP
The Pedrollo PQ 3000 is a high specification high pressure peripheral pump for use in applications like horticultural fertigation and
spraying, wash-down and high head water transfers where increased pressures are required. The hydraulic end features a special
design to minimise the incidence of impeller jamming and carefully matched component materials including AISI 316 stainless
steel for the pump body and body back plate and bronze for the impeller ensure reliability and durability.

Pumps are fitted with close coupled TEFC brushless induction motors designed for continuous duty. Motors should be fitted with a
DOL starter and an appropriately sized MCB for control and protection.

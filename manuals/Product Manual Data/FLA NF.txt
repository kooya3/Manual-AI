PUMP
NM FIRE UL/FM approved packaged Fire Sets are specially designed to provide automatic water supply to fixed automatic sprinkler firefighting
installations. Fire Pump sets combine single duty diesel and electric powered supply main pumps to ensure serviceability in all conditions as well
as a jockey pump to maintain system pressure. The fire sets have UL/FM approved component certificate of compliance and with the unit
assembled in conformity to NFPA20 standard to ensure reliability of the assembly. Particular features include: • UL/FM approved individual electric motor and diesel engine powered pump sets providing standby supply in event of electrical power
failure.
• Separate automatic jockey pump to maintain system pressure restricting start of main pumps to at least one open sprinkler.
• UL/FM approved independent pump controllers for each pump in conformity with NFPA20 fire standards.
• Main pumps of split casing design with Spacer couplings to allow inspection of the hydraulic parts without disconnection of the piping,
motor, or engine.
• Vibration dampening system on diesel engine-driven pump set(s) consisting of rubber anti-vibration expansion joints that reduce the
amount of vibrations produced by the diesel engine reaching the system.
For all firefighting applications high levels of equipment performance and dependability are vitally important for the protection of both lives and
property. NM FIRE fire pumps combine quality UL/FM approved components for optimal operational efficiency to provide competitive pricing for
effective, reliable, and easy to install firefighting solutions. Capacities outside the listed range can be provided on request.
SPECIFICATIONS
Supply Pumps: UL/FM approved split casing pumps featuring gland packing seal and heavy-duty ductile cast-iron construction with stainless
steel impellers. Pump models are selected to meet the design pressure and flow rates.
Diesel Engine: UL/FM approved NM FIRE non overloading engine suitably rated for pump load fitted with residential type silencer for noise
cancellation. Alternatives engines are available on request. Includes positive suction head metallic fuel tank to improve on reliability.
Electric Motor: Non overloading TEFC squirrel cage 2 POLE 2900rpm electric motors suitably rated for the pump load.
Jockey pump: Option of horizontal or vertical multistage pumps fitted with electric motor.
Pressure Vessel: Low maintenance diaphragm type pressure vessel to regulate the jockey pump cycling.
Piping: The suction consists of an eccentric taper and concentric expanders for the delivery line together with suitably sized piping to ensure low
velocity suction requirements as per NFPA20 standards. Provisions for pump priming.
Control System: UL/FM approved Tornatech electric and engine pump controllers that are NEMA2 enclosure complaint.

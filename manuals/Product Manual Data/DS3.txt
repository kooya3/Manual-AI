PUMP
DAYLIFF DS submersible pumps are designed specifically for borehole supply applications. They are of multistage centrifugal
impeller design and all parts are made from premium AISI304 stainless steel with water lubricated rubber bearings. A submersible
motor is fitted beneath the pump and suction is effected through a strainer between the pump and motor.
MOTOR
The pump is coupled to a sealed liquid cooled 2-pole asynchronous squirrel-cage motor constructed of stainless steel. Single phase
motors should be supplied with purpose designed Dayliff SCM control boxes for operation and protection against overload, dry
running and over/under voltage. Three phase motors require a remote DOL starter; A DAYLIFF SCT electronic Pump Controller is
recommended for comprehensive pump control including low level, motor overload and irregular power supply protection.

Ultrasun UFX Flatplate solar hot water systems are high specification thermosyphon type hot water heaters designed for long life operation in
extreme conditions. Options are available for direct and indirect systems, direct system heat the water directly through the collector and indirect
systems separate the collector flow water from the through flow water, heat being transferred through the tank jacket. This is suitable for
mineralised and brackish water that may corrode or scale the collector's capillaries. Features include:• Heavy duty tank which includes a steel powder coated outside casing, steel storage tank internally coated with glazed enamel and fitted
with a magnesium sacrificial anode for exceptional corrosion protection, steel powder coated end caps and a 3kW heating element with
thermostat.
• Flatplate solar collectors that incorporate full area selective copper plates laser welded to copper circulation tubes, high specification
insulation and tempered security glass to provide energy absorption of up to 95%.
• Low thermal conductivity high specification flexible stainless steel circulation piping with PVC coated elastomeric rubber foam insulation
jackets.
• Connection piping that includes an incoming non-return valve, pressure release valve rated at 6bar and drain cock. An added 3bar
pressure release valve is provided for indirect tanks.
• Galvanised mounting frame for both flat or inclined roof installations that ensures high durability in all weather conditions
Ultrasun UFX Flatplate solar systems are available in various tank sizes and collector configurations to suit domestic and small-scale
installation applications. They are efficient and robust products guaranteed for five years to demonstrate the high material specification.
Designed for many years of trouble free operations, they are the ideal solution for all solar water heating applications.

AUTOMATIC TRANSFER
SWITCHES (ATS)

The Dayliff range of Auto Transfer Switches are specially designed for automatic switching of power supply between mains
and generator inputs according to load requirements. They are specificied for applications with Dayliff generators fitted
with DSE modules and include motorised 4-pole breakers powered by a signal from the module. Manual power change
over is also provided. The units are fitted with indicator lights to show active power and connection status.
Dayliff ATS switches may also be supplied with a separate Manual bypass switch for applications where uninterrupted
supply is required. The bypass switches are manually operated to allow primary power supply to be connected to the load
while isolating the ATS for operational reasons.

DSE857 is a controller that allows BMS integration of generators fitted with DSE controllers. The module enables DSE
controllers with USB connectivity to be converted to RS485 connection which enables communication with MODBUS RTU
master within a1.2km distance.
Connection to the module is via a USB cable while a RS485 port allows for connection to a Modbus master device such as
a PC, Building Management System (BMS), PLC or other Modbus master device.

DSE890 MODULE

DSE890 is a Gateway module used for remote communication on generators fitted with compatible DSE controllers. It
connects the Generator module to the DSE data server by GPRS (GSM or 3G mobile internet) and includes GPS (satellite
location) functionality. GSM and GPS antennas are provided separately for installation and the system offers an ideal
solution for genset maintenance, remote/periodic testing, fault analysis and genset tracking. It also offers mapping with
real-time location, instrumentation and control, event log tables and system alerts with information being relayed via email
or SMS and accessible to a number of authorized users through smart phone devices, tablets or laptops.
Parameters monitored varies depending on the module fitted with the key ones being Genset Parameters (Volts – Line and
Phase, Amps, kW, kVA, kVAr, pf, kWh, kVAh, kVAr), Mains Parameters, Engine Status and Parameters, Digital Input and
Output Status as well as Alarm Status.

DF DC FUEL
TRANSFER PUMP

A self-priming rotary vane DC type pump specifically designed for diesel or kerosene transfer. They are particularly suited
for use on generators for the transfer of fuel from bulk storage to main supply tanks. The pump features a cast iron body
and composite vane impeller and is fitted with either a 12 or 24V DC brush motor with PMG stator, to suit the battery
voltage of the system. The pump should only be used for intermittent service of maximum 1 hour work cycles followed by at
least 30 minutes rest.
Fuel level sensors with electrical outputs are available for automatic start/stop operation. A small panel which houses the
components of the fuel transfer circuit is recommended and must be used with appropriate gauge to suit fuel tank depth,
sizes available being 130mm, 160mm and 210mm.

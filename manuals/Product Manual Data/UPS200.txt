PUMP
The GRUNDFOS UPS circulator pumps are designed for water circulation in heating, hot water, cooling or air conditioning systems
where the duty requires high water volumes at low pressures. Three standard models are available, but options include single or
two head units and alternative specifications for cold water and very low pressure installations. A particular feature of the pump
design is that the motors have three speed settings so it is possible to select the ideal flow to meet the system requirements.
Pump construction is AISI304 stainless steel for the impeller and bearing plate, cast iron for the pump housing and diecast
aluminium for the rotor housing.
MOTOR
The integral 2-pole asynchronous squirrel-cage motor is designed to operate at three speeds. Motors should be connected to
mains supply though an MCB and suitably sized DOL starter.

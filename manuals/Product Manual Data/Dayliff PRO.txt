Reverse Osmosis is the most effective method of totally purifying water and the technology is now well proven. Traditional RO systems are
complicated to operate and maintain, though as a result of creative thinking and extensive research Pentair Water, part of one of the world's largest
corporations, has developed the Modular PRO system that provides excellent pure water quality with simple operation and can be scaled to
provide a range of system sizes. These RO units are incorporated as the core component of the innovative range of Dayliff PRO treatment units, all
of which offer the following features:•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Three stage treatment including polypropylene sediment and activated carbon pre-treatment filtration followed by series connected
Pentair PRO membranes.
Strong individual corrosion proof plastic housing units for the pre-treatment and RO cartridges.
High treatment performance with up to 95% salt rejection.
Modular design with outputs from 100 to 400l/hr
Available with options of either solar powered Shurflo (PRO1 size only) or mains powered Pedrollo pumps.
All Pedrollo pump options include a pump controller for automatic pump operation.
Supplied as complete units base frame mounted with all internal piping connections and control accessories including pressure gauge
and flow meter.

Featuring reliability, high efficiency and simple operation the Dayliff PRO water purification systems are the ideal solution for all small scale
domestic and commercial applications where there is a requirement for totally pure water. Solar Power Option is available on request.
OPERATING PARAMETERS
Raw Water Quality: Conductivity<3130 or TDS level <2000ppm NaCl, chlorine <0.1mg/l, Hardness <170mg/l, iron <0.1mg/l,
manganese <0.05mg/l, turbidity <1 NTU. Raw Water outside these limits should be pre-treated accordingly.
Water Temperature Range: 100C-320C. Design Temperature 250C
Operating Pressure Range: 2.5-6 Bar
Flow Rates: Given flow rates are indicative and will depend upon raw water quality and system pressure, performance for one module being
given in the graph. Standard flow rates are based upon 750mg/l TDS, 250C, 3.4Bar and 25% recovery.
Membranes: Type Pentair TLC350, Recovery range 10-50%, Average Salt Rejection - 94% NaCl.
Filters: Max Flow 0.8m3/hr, Capacity - 20m3, Micron - 3µ(carbon), 10µ (Sediment). Inlet / Outlet: ½”

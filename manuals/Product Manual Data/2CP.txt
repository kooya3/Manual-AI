PUMP
The PEDROLLO 2CP pump range are twin impeller centrifugal pumps with close coupled motors. They are suitable for higher
pressure domestic and industrial applications and are specially designed for continuos heavy duty use. A special feature of the
design is a 'back-to-back' impeller configuration which balances radial loads and prolongs motor bearing life.
The pump body is constructed from cast iron and the impellers from brass alloy.
MOTOR
The close coupled fan cooled TEFC three-phase induction motors are non overloading and designed for continuous duty. A remote
starter with thermal overload is necessary for motor protection.

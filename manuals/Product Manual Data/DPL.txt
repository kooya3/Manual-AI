The DAYLIFF DPL range of swimming pool pumps are quiet running and reliable products suitable for all domestic pool
applications. All models feature a large strainer basket with easy-open transparent cover and connecting unions and all hydraulic
components are made from high strength glass reinforced corrosion resistant polypropylene for long life.
Fixed and variable speed model options are available, variable speed providing three pre-set speed options for reduced energy
consumption in periods of low pool usage.
MOTOR
DPL 550/750/1100 Fixed Speed - Asynchronous two pole TEFC motor designed for continuous duty and provided with builtin thermal overload protection. Motors can be connected directly to the mains power supply through a 10A fuse of MCB.
DPL 750 VS Variable Speed - Brushless permanent magnet synchronous motor fitted with an inbuilt frequency converter to
provide three pre-set operating speeds 3450rpm, 2850rpm and 1500rpm. Intelligent protection from overvoltage, under voltage,
overload and short circuit is also provided for extended motor life. The motor is also suitable for 50&60Hz frequency supply.
Motor control is through an easy to operate control module on the pump which provides various control options and digital speed
indication.
All motors can be connected directly to the mains electrical supply through a 10A MCB or switch fuse.

Huawei Power-S is an integrated hybrid solar power supply & backup solution providing reliable and consistent power supply from 10kW
to 60kW in various commercial and industrial applications. Systems optimize solar power generation feeding directly into the site load
whilst also charging the battery pack for night time, supplementary and back-up supply. External power from either mains supply or
generator is also fed into the system to top up for the demand load as necessary. Features include:• Seamless uninterrupted power with <10mS switchover from energy sources.
• All-in-one integrated systems of battery, inverter, solar MPPT controller and hybrid energy management system.
• Modular design with 10kW inverters scalable to 60kW, 30kWh Lithium batteries scalable to 120kWh and solar power PV input of up
to 144kW. Systems can be specified to suit individual site conditions and requirements.
• Cabinet mounted including all components for simple site installation
• Centralised monitoring and control on remote App
• Intelligent generator control (when fitted) enabling reduced generator sizing
Huawei Power S provides continuous and seamless power from the optimal supply source at minimum cost and maximum efficiency
ensuring uninterrupted power in all power supply conditions.

Dosatron proportional chemical feeders are a unique solution for accurate in-line injection of a wide range of chemicals for
various water treatment, agricultural and industrial applications. Installed directly on the raw water supply line, a hydraulic motor
pump uses the water flow as its energy source. This pump in turn activates the dosing piston. Particular benefits are:• Fully automatic operation with dosage directly proportional to flow.
• Simple to install and no external power source required.
• Highly accurate and consistent dosage externally adjustable as required.
• Accommodates large dosage ranges and operating pressures.
Dosatron is principally used for water treatment applications particularly chlorination. Installation is simple and can be in line
taking the full water flow or on a bypass for larger flow rates. Speacilised application products are available on request.
Built principally from high quality engineering plastics and incorporating simple mechanical components, Dosatron feeders are
designed for long-term reliability and durability. Now extensively proven the world over, Dosatron is established as the preferred
option whenever consistent and accurate chemical dosage is an essential requirement for any production or environmental
process.
OPERATING PRINCIPLE

OPERATING CONDITIONS
Feed Water: Thin, clean non aggressive liquids without fibres
or particles pre-filtered to atleast 300 micron (50 mesh). Pretreatment is required for feed water with higher levels of
suspended solids.
Chemical Concentrate: Thin, clean chemicals including most
acids, alkalis and polymers for standard units. Special models are
available for aggresive and viscous chemicals and can be
specified on request.
Operating Water Temp: Min 50C - Max400C
Average Dosage Accuracy: +/-5%
Repeatability: +/-3% (API standard)
Suction Performance: self-priming, max4m
Viscosity: PV kit required above 200 cSt at 200C and max with
PV kit 400 cSt

PUMP
Futurepumps SE1 & SF2 are robust solar powered irrigation pumps specially designed for small scale agricultural applications using low pressure
spray, hoses and drip distribution. They comprise three principal components, the PV solar modules, a specially designed DC motor that is coupled to
a flywheel and a positive displacement reciprocating piston type pump. Features include:
• High efficiency pump that is tolerant to water containing suspended solids and also capable of running dry without damage.
• Supplied with comprehensive spare parts kit and tools.
• Horizontal discharge upto 500m.
• Manufacturer supported five year operating warranty
Futurepump SE1 pump specification;
• Supplied with 1x60W solar panel
• Fitted with a 36V, 2.5A DC motor with in-built controller
• Supplied complete with 8mx1” inlet/suction hose with couplers and strainer
Futurepump SF2 pump specification:
• Supplied with 2x60W (120W) solar panel. Panels include USB port for charging small electronic devices
• Fitted with a 60VDC motor with in-built controller
• Includes remote performance monitoring data logger that indicates pump performance and tracked location.
• Two pulley sizes for motor drive for low and high head applications
• Supplied complete with 6mx11¼” inlet/suction hose with couplers and strainer
A special feature of Futurepumps is their simplicity of design and operation being simple to set up and maintain by the user. They are also flexible in
operation and efficient and are the ideal solution for all small scale farmer irrigation applications.
PUMP OUTPUTS
Performance curves are given at standard test conditions of 1000W/m2 solar irradiance and 250C temperature. Output will vary throughout the year
depending upon prevailing irradiation levels. For estimated daily outputs at continuous pumping multiply the indicated output at the duty point by the
daily irradiation given in the graph. For indicative purposes, factors of 1.1 can be applied for hot arid areas and 0.9 for temperate high altitude areas
in the Tropics.

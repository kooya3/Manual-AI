Dayliff DLIP Lithium Iron Phosphate (LiFePO4) batteries with Battery Management System control are high-performance products
matched to the Dayliff DUV Ultraverter multifunction inverters with principal applications for solar power system storage and mains
power supply backup. They offer many benefits including enhanced power output, considerably extended life and cooler operation
in high temperatures and are especially suited to high specification installations. Particular benefits include:• 100% depth of discharge with a design life of up to 8000 cycles, 4 times the life of a comparable Lead Acid type for 48VDC
batteries and 6000 cycles at 80% depth of discharge for 12/24VDC batteries.
• Constant discharge voltage that enables the battery to deliver nearly full power until it is fully discharged. This also greatly
simplifies voltage regulation control.
• Lighter weight but higher energy density to similar capacity Lead Acid alternatives.
• Low self-discharge rate of 3% per month.
• Built in battery charge/discharge protection.
• Excellent resistance to over and under charge with no damaging effects.
• Maintenance free, totally safe and environmentally friendly.
• 48VDC DLIP batteries are equipped with BMS software protection and batteries should only be connected in parallel. Series
connection will result in battery damage.
• 12/24VDC lithium batteries have inbuilt BMS hardware protection, series connection can be done up to 48VDC.
In every aspect of performance Lithium Iron Phosphate batteries offer a much superior solution over the Lead Acid alternatives and
though of higher capital cost deliver the more economical long term outcome due to their greatly increased life, consistent power
output and better charge/discharge performance. For high specification systems where enhanced performance is demanded and
reliability is essential they are the preferred choice.

PUMP
The PEDROLLO SKR is a self priming centrifugal pump designed for pumping water in general water distribution and is particularly
suited to irrigation applications.
Pump body is constructed from cast iron with an epoxy electrocoating treatment for corrosion protection while the impellers are
made from Noryl.
MOTOR
Pumps are close coupled to TEFC brushless induction motor designed for continuous operation. A thermal relay is provided in the
windings to protect against electrical and mechanical overload and the pump can be connected directly to the mains power supply
through a 10amp fuse or MCB.

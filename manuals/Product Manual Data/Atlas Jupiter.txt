SCHEMATIC INSTALLATION LAYOUT

Atlas 'Jupiter' water softeners use the ion exchange principal for the removal of hardness in water exchanging the Calcium and
Magnesium ions, which cause the hardness condition, with Sodium ions using the medium of a strong cationic resin bed. The filter
bed is regenerated at regular intervals using Sodium Chloride (Brine) solution by a backwash process during which the removal
hardness ions are flushed to waste. All softeners include the following:l Strong GRP reinforced polyethylene resin tank designed for long life.
l Polyethylene brine tank with drain piping.
l Control valve that automatically cycles the regeneration process on either a volume or time elapsed basis depending upon

parameter specifications. Regeneration can be programmed according to operating conditions.
l A filter charge of cationic ion exchange resin.

Atlas 'Jupiter' water softeners are quality units designed for continuous operation in small flow requirements including domestic,
process and industrial applications. The combined features of simplicity of operation and robust design make them an ideal
solution for all softening requirements.
SOFTENER SIZING
Softeners are rated by their exchange capacity, which is in the quantity of Calcium that is removable between regenerations and is
determined by the resin performance and resin capacity. Equipment sizing is then computed on the basis of the raw water hardness
and the required brine regeneration period, 24hrs being the minimum.
For example the Jupiter 30AVL has an exchange capacity of 2250mg CaCO3and for water of 200ppm CaCO3 hardness the
treatment volume is 2250/200 =11.25m3 between regenerations. Assuming a 10 hour operating period/day and daily
regeneration the required flow rate is 1m3/hr.
Note that softening performance is reduced by increased TDS levels and it is necessary to compute compensated hardness when
TDS levels exceed 400ppm as follows:- Compensated Hardness (ppmCaCO3) - Measured Hardness (ppmCaCO3) x 9000
9000 - TDS level (ppm)

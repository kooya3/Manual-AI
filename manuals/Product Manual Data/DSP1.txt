PUMP
The DAYLIFF DSP range of submersible multistage centrifugal pumps are specially designed for domestic and small scale water
supply from wells and boreholes. Material of construction include Noryl impellers, glass filled polycarbonate diffusers, stainless
steel inlet and outlet chambers, stage casings, shaft and pump housing. These quality materials together with the floating type
impeller design provide the pumps with efficient performance excellent sand handling capabilities and long life.
MOTOR
The pump is coupled to a two pole sealed motor constructed principally from stainless steel. A separate control box is also
available which incorporates an isolator, run indicator light, thermal overload protection and starting capacitor which can be
connected directly to mains power. The box is also provided with auxiliary terminals for control probes, pressure switch or float
switch. A separate SCM control box is also available on request for automatic operation and protection against overload, dry
running and over/under voltage.

Solarix PRS 2020, 3030 and PR 3030 PWM type charge controllers offer high performance and
simple operation as well as many protection features. They offer automatic detection for either
12VDC or 24VDC configuration and a multi coloured LED or LCD display indicates

Tarom 4545-48 PWM charge controller is designed for use with inverter AC systems. The controller
combine basic solar charger functions with 45A input and is available for 12V, 24V and 48V
systems. A text type LCD display is provided that indicates operating parameters and fault
messages. All controllers provide various electronic protection functions including overcharge,
over voltage, over temperature and over load with an automatic electronic fuse.

Opti SC-SM smart PWM charge controllers are high specification simple to use units for general
solar charging control applications, particularly for solar lighting control. Features include
temperature sensing for compensation of charge voltage, battery type and protection level
selection, intelligent voltage regulation that selects three stages of charging and a unique
adjustable lamp dimming function. The controller is fitted with LED's that display various operating
and fault conditions and also protects against current, voltage and charge levels outside set limits.
Opti SC MAX charge controllers are advanced technology units that feature automatic system
voltage recognition, various battery working mode and protection options, charge intensity
selection, electronic overload protection and an LCD display.
Opti SC MPPT charge controllers are advanced design MPPT (Maximum Power Point Tracker) type
electronic units that are particularly designed for operation with inverter systems. MPPT technology
optimally matches power between the PV solar array and the battery bank and typically giving a 2530% power gain over PWM regulation. All units are provided with an LCD display that indicates
input and output voltage and current, charge mode, battery charge status and energy outputs.

DAYLIFF

The DAYLIFF solar charge controller is of advanced design with Maximum Power Point Tracking
(MPPT) applying an intelligent ultra-fast algorithm that enables the controller to extract maximum
power from solar arrays. The battery charging process is also optimized for long battery life and
improved system performance. Self-diagnostics and electronic error protections prevent damage
when installation errors or system faults occur .
• Rated charge current 30 and 40A
• Automatic Battery Voltage recognition
• Maximum efficiency 98 %

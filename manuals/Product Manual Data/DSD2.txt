PUMP
DAYLIFF DSD range of submersible multistage centrifugal pumps are specially designed for water supply from wells and boreholes. Material of
construction include polycarbonate impellers and diffusers, AISI 201 stainless steel delivery and suction chambers and AISI 304 stainless steel
pump housing, shaft and shaft coupling. These corrosion resistant materials together with the advanced hydraulic design provide the pumps with
excellent sand handling capabilities for a longer life and operational efficiency. DSD 2/9, 2/15 and 2/18 are supplied complete with 30m cable
and control box.
MOTOR
The pump is coupled to a sealed liquid cooled 2-pole asynchronous squirrel-cage motor constructed of stainless steel. Single phase motors
should be supplied with purpose designed Dayliff SCM control boxes for operation and protection against overload, dry running and over/under
voltage. Three phase motors require a remote DOL starter; A DAYLIFF SCT electronic Pump Controller is recommended for comprehensive pump
control including low level, motor overload and irregular power supply protection
